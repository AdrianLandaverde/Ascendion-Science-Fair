# %AMAZON

The Amazon is a vast biome that spans eight rapidly developing countries—Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, and Suriname—and French Guiana, an overseas territory of France.

The landscape contains

- about one in 10 known species on Earth
- 1.6 billion acres of dense forests, around half of the planet's remaining tropical forests
- 20% of the world's liquid freshwater
- 2.7 million square miles in the Amazon basin, about 40% of South America

There is a clear link between the health of the Amazon and the health of the planet. The rain forests, which contain an estimated 150-200 billion tons of carbon, help stabilize the local and global climate. Deforestation releases significant amounts of this carbon, which is having negative consequences around the world.

CONTINENT: South America
SPECIES: Jaguar, Macaw, Amazon River Dolphin, Black Spider Monkey, Poison Dart Frog

## %SPECIES

The Amazon contains millions of species, most of them still undescribed, and some of the world's most unusual wildlife. It is one of Earth's last refuges for jaguars, harpy eagles, and pink river dolphins, and home to thousands of birds and butterflies. Tree-dwelling species include southern two-toed sloths, pygmy marmosets, saddleback and emperor tamarins, and Goeldi's monkeys. The diversity of the region is staggering:

- close to 50,000 plant species
- about 2,400 freshwater fish species
- more than 370 types of reptiles

To protect these species, WWF works with local communities, partner nongovernmental organizations, corporations, and governments to ensure that deforestation and degradation of rivers are alleviated.

The main species are:

- MACAW
- JAGUAR
- POISON DART FROG
- BLACK SPIDER MONKEY
- AMAZON RIVER DOLPHIN
- SLOTH

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

More than 40 million people, including over 400 Indigenous and ethnic groups, live in the Amazon and depend on nature for agriculture, clothing, and traditional medicines. Most live in large urban centers, but all residents rely on the Amazon’s natural bounty for food, shelter, and livelihoods. People also use the region’s waterways for transport, much like those in the Peruvian Amazon pictured above.

## %THREATS

Despite its mighty splendor, the Amazon’s forest and freshwater systems are fragile and at risk. Reason why, its main threats are:

- POORLY PLANNED INFRASTRUCTURE
- ILLEGAL AND UNSUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION
- CLIMATE CHANGE
- LAND SPECULATION AND AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION

### %THREATS: POORLY PLANNED INFRASTRUCTURE

Transportation and energy infrastructure are essential for national and regional development, but when they are poorly planned, negative impacts can exceed short-term benefits. For example, building new roads exposes previously inaccessible areas of forest to illegal and unsustainable logging as well as illegal or unplanned settlements and agricultural expansion.

Hydropower is now used to meet the region's growing demand for energy, but many dams are being constructed in areas of high conservation value. The dams:

- disrupt river connectivity
- block the range of many aquatic species, including migratory fish and river dolphins
- interfere with some subsistence and commercial fisheries

To minimize the impacts of hydropower, WWF is promoting scenario planning that explores alternative energy options and promotes transboundary cooperation for river basin management. WWF has also mapped out freshwater connectivity corridors across the basin. This work has allowed us to pinpoint stretches of river that are most critical for connectivity to be maintained for the future health of the Amazon basin, its communities, and flagship freshwater species.

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL AND UNSUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION
There is high demand for the natural resources found in the Amazon but weak law enforcement to safeguard them. In addition, inefficient extraction processes lead to the destruction of nature and wildlife. For example, mining activities contribute to soil erosion and water contamination. Mercury contamination of Amazonian waters from artisanal mining is of particular concern given the consequential impacts on human health and contamination of the food chain for fish and wildlife.

WWF works to promote best practices and decrease environmental damage from:

- illegal logging
- overharvesting of fish and other aquatic species
- oil exploration
- gold mining

### %THREATS: CLIMATE CHANGE

The Amazon is critical to our efforts to avoid a climate catastrophe. Water vapor released from the Amazon creates vast “flying rivers” in the atmosphere, which influence rainfall and thus agricultural production in central and southern South America. And the billions of tons of carbon stored in the Amazon rain forest is of global importance to slowing climate change.

But the Amazon is threatened by rising deforestation. Unprecedented droughts are happening with growing frequency. Dry seasons are hotter and longer. Long dry spells wither crops, decimate fisheries, and lead to forest fires. This can result in significant shifts in the makeup of ecosystems and a loss of species.

According to many notable scientists, including longtime friend of WWF Tom Lovejoy, the Amazon is close to a tipping point past which it will no longer be able to sustainably support itself. To ensure the Amazon’s future, for its people and biodiversity, deforestation in the region should not exceed 20%, and it is already at approximately 17%. Our vision is one of zero net deforestation in the Amazon to safeguard this globally important ecosystem.

### %THREATS: LAND SPECULATION AND AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION
There are several economic incentives in place that contribute to deforestation in the Amazon: Real estate speculation is a major driver. The price of land in the Amazon can increase up to tenfold once the forest has been cleared.  

Amazon forests also suffer as global demand for products such as beef and soy increases. Forests are cleared for more and more cattle grazing pasture and cropland. These growing industries displace small farmers, forcing them into forested areas they must clear to sustain themselves. 

Cattle pastures occupy about 80% of deforested areas in the Brazilian Amazon. Cattle ranching is also a major driver of deforestation in Colombia and Bolivia. Pasture runoff contaminates rivers. Fire used to manage fields often spreads into the remaining forests. The deforestation caused by ranching also contributes to climate change. 

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

Protecting and conserving the Amazon, a place two-thirds the size of the United States, is a big job. WWF has been working in the Amazon since the 1970s and is at the forefront of efforts to protect the people, forests, and species that call it home. We engage local communities and partner with governments to identify solutions that bridge the needs of economic development and conservation.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CONFRONTING DRIVERS OF DEFORESTATION AND RESULTING HABITAT LOSS

Each year, the Amazon loses thousands of square miles of forested area. Agricultural expansion, ranching, infrastructure projects, energy exploration, and illegal logging are to blame. We address the following:

- Soy farming: WWF works with the Soy Roundtable—made up of soy producers, processors, and exporters—to improve the sustainability of the participants’ practices and minimize the impact on the Amazon and its wildlife. WWF is also a part of the collaborative group of NGOs behind the Soy Moratorium, a voluntary agreement between transnational trading companies, soy producers, and civil society in Brazil to ban the conversion of Amazon forests to soy after 2006, which drastically reduced deforestation for soy cultivation in the region. This was a critical first step toward taking deforestation and conversion out of soy supply chains, though more work is needed to avoid leakage of this issue to nearby ecosystems like the Cerrado savanna and Chaco woodlands.
- Cattle ranching: WWF works with the beef industry to create standards that increase efficiency and reduce waste. This includes educating ranchers about why it is not necessary to convert more forests into pasture to increase profits. WWF works through the Global and US Beef Roundtables to develop principles and criteria that increase the productivity of existing cattle ranches and prevent the establishment of new ranches in high conservation value forests. Beginning with support from the Moore Foundation and now with an additional grant from the Tapestry Foundation, WWF is also working with brands and tanneries around the world to develop deforestation- and conversion-free sources of hides coming from South America, catalyzing efforts to ensure that hides don’t come from deforested land.
- Hydropower: Improperly sited dams can have significant impacts on fisheries, wildlife, and people who depend upon them. WWF supports low-carbon, low-cost, and low-conflict energy sources, particularly through energy scenario planning that considers alternative development options and siting of needed energy infrastructure in locations that minimize impacts on people and nature.
- Illegal and unsustainable logging: High demand for timber products, weak laws, and poorly implemented trade rules lead to logging that destroys nature. WWF works to create market conditions that conserve the world’s forests but also provide economic and social benefits for businesses and people. To do so, WWF works to strengthen the US government’s ability to prosecute illegal timber cases; stop illegal logging in countries that export high volumes of timber; and ensure full implementation of the Lacey Act, a US law that prohibits illegal timber and timber products from entering the US market.
Infrastructure: In Colombia, WWF partnered with the government to create participatory, ecologically sustainable road development processes. In February 2021, the government of Colombia announced the Green Road Infrastructure (GRI) Guidelines, a set of national government guidelines for building sustainable and resilient road transport infrastructure. The Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, WWF-Colombia, and the Colombian NGO Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development collaborated to design the guidelines. The guidelines are a major achievement for the people of Colombia and the Amazon, taking into consideration the needs of local people as well as the health of this critical region.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: DEVELOPING A SUSTAINABLE FOREST ECONOMY

Regional and global demand for natural resources, including timber and fish, can be met without devastating the environment. We work with agriculture and timber sectors to eliminate waste and increase production efficiency. 

We also seek to promote demand for sustainable forest products. WWF engages local Indigenous communities and governments to manage protected areas and supports local communities’ ability to earn a living sustainably. For example, as part of the US Agency for International Development-funded Amazon Indigenous Rights and Resources (AIRR) project, WWF is focused on encouraging the development and scaling of Indigenous enterprises based on the sustainable use of forest products, fisheries management, and aquaculture.  And in a protected area in Bolivia, WWF supports training and organic certification for sustainable Brazil nut harvesting. 

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING FORESTS

WWF collaborates with governments across the Amazon to create, manage, and permanently fund protected forest areas using the Project Finance for Permanence (PFP) approach.

In Brazil, through the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program, WWF worked to support and expand a network of parks covering 154 million acres of forest. This area is over 50% larger than the US National Park System. Between 2008 and 2020, the protected areas supported by ARPA prevented 1,000 square miles of deforestation, equivalent to 104 million tons of avoided  CO2 emissions.

In Colombia, an ambitious effort by organizations, including WWF, and environmental authorities is protecting approximately 79 million acres of ocean and forest, including Serranía de Chiribiquete National Park, the world’s largest national park protecting a tropical rain forest. This initiative, called Heritage Colombia, is helping Colombia achieve its forest conservation goals and 30x30 target to protect 30% of its ocean by 2030.

In Peru, the Peruvian government-led effort, known as National Parks: Peru’s Natural Legacy, will permanently protect nearly 41 million acres in the Peruvian Amazon and secure 7.5 billion metric tons of carbon. The initiative supports greater resilience to climate change and benefits 1.4 million people who depend on Peru’s rainforests for food, medicines, and clean energy.

Taken together, ARPA, Heritage Colombia, and Peru's Natural Legacy permanently protect 12% of the entire Amazon rain forest.

## %We're off track to protect and restore forests by 2030. Here's how we can change course.

A startling increase in the speed and intensity of global deforestation has derailed efforts to protect and restore forests by 2030, according to two new reports analyzing progress toward global forest conservation goals.

WWF's Forest Pathways 2023 report and the Forest Declaration Assessment detail the immense scale of forest loss just two years after more than 130 countries representing 85% of the planet's forests pledged to halt and reverse deforestation by the end of the decade. The lack of progress on commitments leaves the world in clear danger of missing vital targets.

In 2022, global deforestation reached 16.3 million acres, with primary tropical forest loss at 10.1 million acres. An alarming 96% of this takes place in tropical regions. Tropical Asia is the only region close to achieving zero deforestation. Without urgent action, tropical forests will begin to act as a carbon source, not a sink, under the pressures of a warming, drying, and increasingly extreme climate. Widespread and increasing deforestation and degradation in the planet's three largest tropical forest basins—the Amazon, Congo, and the forests of Asia-Pacific—could deliver a global climate catastrophe.

Fortunately, there's still time to halt deforestation and sustainably manage and restore forests in ways that benefit people and nature.

"If we're serious about ensuring a future for forests—and halting the biodiversity and climate crises—time is of the essence," said Kerry Cesareo, senior vice president for forests at WWF. "While the numbers are stark, we know what we need to do. And the Forest Pathways report provides tangible guidance for decision-makers, from governments to financial institutions to private sector actors."

Globally, at least 100 times more public funding goes to environmentally harmful subsidies than financing to help forests. Only $2.2 billion in public funds is channeled to forests each year—a mere fraction compared to other global investments. Indigenous peoples and local communities do not receive the necessary resources to secure their rights and effectively manage their lands, even though tropical forests under their stewardship are better protected and deforestation and degradation are lower.

Forest Pathways outlines specific steps countries can take to save forests.

In addition to calling for governments to meet their financial promises, the report sets out a blueprint to save forests by 2030, with essential measures, including:

- Ending forest-harming investments and subsidies such as agricultural subsidies responsible for the loss of 5.4 million acres of forest per year;
- Reforming the rules of global trade that harm forests, cutting deforesting commodities out of global supply chains, and removing barriers to forest-friendly goods;
- Accelerating the recognition of land rights to Indigenous peoples;
- And making the shift toward nature-based economies.

Forest Pathways also includes specific case studies detailing efforts underway across the globe to confront deforestation. These include the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program in Brazil and WWF's signature corporate engagement program for forests, Forests Forward.

WWF urges governments and businesses to heed the warnings from the new data and take urgent action to protect and restore forests, including supporting the passage of the FOREST Act and enforcement of the Lacey Act in the United States. 

Forests are at the heart of WWF's work. We've supported the creation of protected areas, helped move the forest sector toward sustainability and transparency, and galvanized momentum around forest landscape restoration. We're also working alongside local and global partners to halt deforestation, help restore forests, and put deforestation-free commitments into action around the world.

## %Protecting millions of acres in the Amazon

The Amazon helps stabilize the global climate and is home to more than 40 million people and around 10% of the world’s known species. To protect the world’s largest tropical rain forest, Brazil launched the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program with WWF and partners in 2002, setting an aspirational goal: permanently secure more than 150 million acres of the Brazilian Amazon.

Two decades later, ARPA has exceeded that vision, with its protected areas totaling 154 million acres, an area nearly 1.5 times the size of California. Through sustainable financing and strong community partnerships, ARPA has safeguarded biodiversity, protected natural resources, and reduced deforestation by approximately 650,000 acres between 2008 and 2020—preventing significant carbon emissions while supporting local livelihoods.

Large-scale, well-managed protected areas are one of the most effective strategies for keeping forests intact. ARPA will continue to develop and implement novel approaches to conserving this invaluable rain forest—for the next 20 years and beyond

Reduced deforestation in protected areas supported by ARPA has prevented an estimated 104 million tons of CO2 emissions—the total emissions of the US domestic aviation sector in 2020.

## %What the Amazon needs now

Six actions to stop deforestation and conserve biodiversity

The Amazon is in crisis. Deforestation, degradation, and climate change are pushing the Amazon rain forest and river systems to the edge, undermining the future resiliency of the Amazon’s people and ecosystems. Decreased rainfall, siltation, and construction of dams are degrading the quality and connectivity of river systems and jeopardizing aquatic species. In the near future, tropical forests could be replaced by savanna-like vegetation if action isn’t taken to stop deforestation and degradation. With current levels of deforestation in the Amazon at approximately 17%, we must act now.

What we need to do:

1. Increase monitoring and enforcement to stop illegal deforestation and degradation
Recently, leaders of Amazon countries declared they would increase regional cooperation to fight illegal deforestation. This is encouraging and essential—as over 90% of deforestation in Brazil is illegal, and additional efforts are necessary to end the illegal mining that degrades Amazonian rivers and threatens the health of humans and wildlife.

2. Strengthen and build upon the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program
The ARPA program supports effective management of conservation areas and has a demonstrated ability to curb deforestation. Research shows that the protected areas supported by ARPA prevented about 650,000 acres of deforestation, the equivalent of avoiding roughly 104 million tons of CO2 emissions, or an amount equal to the total emissions of US domestic aviation in 2020.

In general, Project Finance for Permanence models, such as ARPA, are an opportunity to align public, private, multilateral, and philanthropic institutions in an actively coordinated arrangement to support large-scale and long-term conservation in the Amazon and other critical ecosystems. Ensuring protections and conservation efforts extend to freshwater ecosystems and the services that they deliver is essential.

3. Support Indigenous peoples and local communities in the management and sustainable development of their territories and community lands
Indigenous peoples and local communities are the most effective stewards of their lands, and supporting their leadership and rights is essential to long-term conservation. Governments, donors, and the private sector must collaborate with Indigenous peoples and local communities to support their rights to manage their lands; promote economic and nature-based opportunities that strengthen local peoples' livelihoods; and enhance access to finance, technology, and social services.

4. Stop the production and importation of commodities sourced from deforested lands
One of the biggest drivers of deforestation and conversion in the Amazon and Cerrado savanna is the production of commodities like beef, soy, and leather. To curb this, we urgently need market incentives for the production of zero-deforestation commodities—such as company reporting of deforestation risks and financial support for producers to transition to deforestation- and conversion-free practices.

The private sector cannot act alone: Countries that import forest products also have a role to play. The US Congress and president have an opportunity to act decisively by enacting the bipartisan FOREST Act. The bill, which will be reintroduced shortly, would prohibit the importation of globally traded commodities sourced from illegally deforested land and ensure that farmers and ranchers have the means to implement more sustainable practices. It’s past time that we break the link between the products we import and consume every day and illegal deforestation in the Amazon.

5. Promote low-impact infrastructure development
Renewable energy and access to the internet and other services are critical needs in the Amazon’s rural and remote communities. At the same time, poorly planned infrastructure development can contribute to habitat destruction by fragmenting forests and rivers, impeding wildlife and freshwater species’ movements and water flows, and making forests more accessible and vulnerable to illegal deforestation. Low-impact infrastructure can bring prosperity to the people of the Amazon without jeopardizing the region’s future.

6. Strengthen science, technology, and innovation to improve sustainability
The transition to long-term sustainable solutions can be complex. It requires an investment in research that produces options for enhancing sustainability and resilience. Further, promoting knowledge-sharing platforms and science-policy interfaces that support evidence-based, transformative policy agendas is critical. Overall, there must be better integration of Indigenous and local knowledge in the design, implementation, and monitoring of all policies, programs, and actions.

## %Biologist Valeria Ramírez Castañeda decodes species evolution in the Amazon

During her undergraduate studies in Bogotá, Valeria Ramírez Castañeda learned that California garter snakes evolved to eat toxic newts, which in turn adapted by becoming more poisonous. This example of coevolution—when two species affect one another’s evolution through natural selection over time—piqued her curiosity: Did similar prey-predator relationships exist in tropical regions?

Ramírez Castañeda’s research led her to the Colombian Amazon, where, as an ecologist and evolutionary biologist, she now studies the interactions between poison dart frogs and colubrids like the royal ground snake that have evolved to resist the frogs’ paralyzing, sometimes deadly, toxins. Supported by a fellowship from WWF’s Russell E. Train Education for Nature Program, she investigates how such reciprocal relationships drive coevolution and help to maintain biodiversity.

The Amazon, home to more than 370 species of reptiles, is one of Earth’s greatest biodiversity puzzles. Losing just one species can decrease the survival odds of others, says Ramírez Castañeda, which can spark “a pyramid of consequences.” With hundreds of thousands of acres deforested each year, untangling that puzzle is urgent.

One hurdle? The royal ground snake is elusive, making it difficult to study. So, for the past decade, Ramírez Castañeda has worked closely with local and Indigenous collaborators in Leticia, a small Colombian city beside the Amazon River, to find and research the reptile. Recently, she introduced a pilot project: asking tuk-tuk drivers to collect run-over snakes for tissue sampling.

Local communities are integral to her research, Ramírez Castañeda says, but they’re often excluded from the conversation. “Scientists publish everything in English, but in the Amazon, most people don’t speak English fluently.” She advocates for translating scientific findings to open the field to diverse audiences and help non-English-speaking communities better protect their flora and fauna, including oft-maligned snakes.

Ramírez Castañeda estimates that thousands of snakes are lost in Colombia every day—most due to deforestation, but also intentional attacks. “People kill snakes because of a lack of information,” she says. “Some are dangerous for humans, but the majority are not.” She hopes that by improving peoples’ understanding of Amazonian reptiles, her work will help conserve them—and the countless species with which they evolved.

## %PROTECTING THE AMAZON'S SWIMWAYS

The Amazon River, one of the most iconic rivers in the world, is more than a single river running through the rain forest. It connects hundreds of rivers and streams (known as tributaries), vast floodplains, and wetlands that cover a wide swath of South America. 

The vast network of rivers and associated wetlands within the Amazon basin allows for movement: of nutrients, of water, and of thousands of species. Like a central highway through a busy city, the Amazon river creates a migratory pathway for animals to find new sources of food, mating grounds, or safe spaces away from predators.

However, proposed dams on many of the Amazon’s tributaries would fragment this important network. The dams would block the movements of aquatic species, including migratory fish, turtles, and river dolphins. On tributaries where dams already exist, fish species that support local fisheries have declined, impacting livelihoods and food security in the region.

WWF, along with scientists from several organizations and academia¹, conducted a review of the use of more than 200,000 miles of Amazonian rivers by long-distance migratory fish and turtle species and river dolphins to develop a map of the most important routes or freshwater connectivity corridors, also known as swimways. By understanding which rivers are critical, decision-makers can take action to protect certain river stretches or otherwise plan for siting or designing infrastructure in alternative, more sustainable ways.

This model could be applied in other river basins around the world to better protect migratory freshwater species by mapping their swimways within river systems.

Without protecting their migratory pathways, we could lose some of the charismatic and unique species of the Amazon.

## %How one Indigenous community uses high-tech tools to defend its territory

The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous people occupy an island of rain forest surrounded by farms in the Brazilian state of Rondônia. Their territory is one of the most important in the region, valued for its rich biodiversity and freshwater sources. Since the 1980s, however, the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau have faced successive invasions by loggers, farmers, and land-grabbers. With deforestation in the Amazon at its highest rate in more than 15 years, their livelihoods and culture are at risk.

To illegally clear land in the Amazon, invaders often burn the forest, leading to wildfires. In the wake of the devastating Amazon wildfires of 2019, WWF collaborated with the Kanindé Association of Ethno-Environmental Protection to supply the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau with terrestrial monitoring equipment—including drones, smartphones, and camera traps—and field training to document illegal deforestation. The drones create high-resolution images, video, and GPS mapping data that allow the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau to discover and record deforestation while avoiding unexpected and potentially deadly confrontations with illegal loggers and land-grabbers.

The tools and training were provided to other Indigenous peoples and territories with support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The grant also allowed WWF to customize software, the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART), to meet the communities' monitoring needs.

After identifying criminal deforestation through drone surveillance, members of the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau register the crime in SMART. The information collected, organized, and mapped can be used by public agencies, nongovernmental organizations, or Indigenous organizations to aid the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau in their fight against deforestation. Combined with the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau's centuries-old knowledge of the area and its ecosystem, land surveillance technology has become an invaluable territorial protection and conservation tool.

The Territory, a new film that premiered in August 2022, features the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau's novel use of these technologies, providing an intimate glimpse into the issue of deforestation on Indigenous land in the Amazon. Directed by Alex Pritz in close collaboration with the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, the documentary won the Audience Award and Special Jury Award for Documentary Craft at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, and critics praised it as an exemplary product of collaborative Indigenous filmmaking. In the film, members of the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau community operate drones to locate sites of forest loss. Aerial footage captures the shocking contrast between lush rain forest and areas cleared for farmland. The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau use this evidence to guide field patrols and inform law enforcement agencies of illegal activity.

During the pandemic, the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau supplied the film team footage, which was incorporated into The Territory. The filmmakers provided camera equipment and remote training to the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, eliminating the health risk of bringing in an external team. And importantly, this gave the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau greater agency in telling their story—to local authorities and the world. The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau used the cameras to create videos to share their experience of isolating from COVID-19 in the rain forest and demand justice for one of their own.

Self-documentation is not only crucial to draw attention to the grave situation in Rondônia but also for the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau to preserve their culture and control their narrative. The power of technology and films can shine a light on the world's most pressing issues, from the urgency of safeguarding threatened biomes to the rights of the Indigenous stewards fighting to protect them.

## %CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF PROTECTING THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON

The vast Amazon rain forest helps stabilize the local and global climate, harbors at least 10% of the world’s known species, and provides a home for more than 40 million people. To permanently protect 150 million acres of the Brazilian Amazon, Brazil established the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program in 2002. Created in partnership with WWF and others, the program is the world’s largest initiative for the conservation of tropical forests.

In 2014, WWF helped launch ARPA for Life, an initiative securing $215 million of long-term funding for the program through an innovative conservation finance approach known as Project Finance for Permanence. These projects secure necessary policy changes and funding to ensure that large-scale systems of conservation areas are well managed, sustainably financed, and benefit the communities that depend on them.

Now, two decades after its creation, ARPA continues to play an essential role in the conservation of this invaluable rain forest, preserving biodiversity, reducing deforestation, and supporting local livelihoods.

"Looking back across ARPA's 20 years, it's amazing to think about the profound impact we've had—for the people of Brazil and the Amazon,” said Meg Symington, WWF’s managing director for the Amazon, who played a crucial role in the development of the program. “I treasure the meaningful partnerships we've forged over two decades and consider myself privileged to have been part of ARPA for so long. I can't wait to see what the next 20 years will bring."

Here are just five of ARPA’s most notable achievements:
Created millions of acres of new protected areas.
ARPA created 57 million acres of protected areas in its first eight years and went on to support the improved management of millions more. ARPA protected areas now total 154 million acres, nearly 1.5 times the size of California, exceeding the program’s initial goal.

Greatly reduced deforestation and associated carbon emissions.
Reducing deforestation in the Amazon rain forest, an important carbon reservoir, is essential for mitigating climate change. Between 2008 and 2020, the protected areas supported by ARPA reduced deforestation by approximately 650,000 acres. This corresponds to an estimated 104 million tons of avoided CO2 emissions—equivalent to the total emissions by American domestic aviation in 2020, or about 17% of emissions by the global domestic aviation sector.

Preserved the Amazon’s biodiversity.
Protected areas are recognized globally as one of the most effective strategies for conserving biodiversity. By minimizing threats like deforestation across millions of acres of standing forests, ARPA has safeguarded valuable diversity in the Amazon that may have otherwise been lost.

Reinforced the balance of protection and sustainable use.
Many people depend on natural resources from forests for their livelihoods, but when resource extraction becomes unsustainable, it threatens the biodiversity and stability of the ecosystem. To meet the needs of people and forests, half of the areas ARPA supports are “integral protection areas,” which strictly limit resource use. The other half are “sustainable use areas,” which seek to balance conservation with the sustainable use of natural resources by local populations.

For example, the Tapajós-Arapiuns Extractive Reserve is a sustainable use area created to protect residents’ rights to their resources. There, communities practice family farming, hunting, fishing, and more—all with sustainability in mind. Açaí, Brazil nuts, and rubber are among the products extracted at the reserve, which is home to nearly 5,000 families.

Led innovation in management and governance.
ARPA’s effectiveness can be partly attributed to the program’s management and governance. By establishing continuous and long-term funding, ARPA was able to look beyond short-term objectives. Management training helps ensure ARPA’s team continues to effectively plan, execute, and monitor its goals. And by obtaining the input and support of multiple stakeholders, including local communities, state and federal governments, civil society, and donors, ARPA has made it more difficult for political or economic changes in Brazil to affect the program’s success.
In the past 20 years, ARPA has evaluated and improved these management mechanisms, constantly developing novel approaches to adapt to an ever-changing Amazonian reality. ARPA for Life also became a model and inspiration for the establishment of future Project Finance for Permanence initiatives in Bhutan, Peru, and, most recently, Colombia.
