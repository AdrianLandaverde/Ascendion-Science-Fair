# %NAMIBIA

Located in southern Africa on the Atlantic Ocean, Namibia consists of 200 million acres of ocean shores, woodland savannas, lush floodplains and picturesque deserts. It is a relatively new country, having achieved its independence in 1990.

Namibia was the first African country to incorporate protection of the environment into its constitution, and the government gave people living in communal areas the opportunity to manage their natural resources through the creation of communal conservancies. These conservancies – as well as governments, nonprofit organizations and other entities – have restored populations of lions, cheetahs, black rhinos, zebras and other native wildlife to the world’s richest dry land. Through initiatives, such as ecotourism, restoration has generated sustainable income for their communities.

CONTINENT: Africa
SPECIES: African elephant, Black rhino, White rhino

## %SPECIES

Namibia’s plankton-rich coastal waters support an extraordinary array of marine life, including an increasing number of southern right whales. Further inland, springbok, gemsbok and black-faced impala have all seen multifold increases in population. Namibia boasts the largest free-roaming population of black rhino in Africa, and the largest cheetah population in the world.

Namibia is also home to a unique population of elephants that have adapted to the arid climate. Found mostly in the northwest part of the country, these "desert-adapted" elephants can go for days without drinking water by surviving on moisture obtained from the vegetation they eat. Although not a different subspecies of savannah elephants, they have several adaptations to their desert environment, including larger feet, which make it easier to walk through sand, and smaller herd sizes, which puts less pressure on their food and water sources.

The main species are:

- BLACK RHINO
- WHITE RHINO
- AFRICAN SAVANNA ELEPHANT
- RHINO

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

More than two million people, the majority of Namibia’s population, live in the northern part of the country. Among Namibia’s 14 ethnic groups, 26 different languages are spoken. The communal conservancy movement, which links conservation to poverty alleviation through sustainable use of natural resources, is a key development strategy for rural Namibia. Approximately one in four rural Namibians now belongs to a registered conservancy.

Namibian women have traditionally been excluded from natural resource management. WWF works with our Namibian partners to change this. Women now make up 35 percent of conservancy committee members, including three committee chairs and the majority of conservancy treasurers. As a result, women are receiving a larger share of benefits and exerting a growing influence over resource management and community development.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- CONFLICT BETWEEN PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE
- EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
- COMPETING FOR LAND AND WATER USE

### %THREATS: CONFLICT BETWEEN PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE

Conflict with wildlife remains a concern where agriculture shares land with wildlife. Namibia’s conservation efforts have helped increase wildlife populations—particularly large animals such as elephants and predators like cheetahs. As these populations grow and their ranges expand, they come into more frequent contact with communities. Farmers see significant losses when elephants raid crops, break down fences and water tanks, or when predators kill livestock.

### %THREATS: EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Increasing temperatures and inconsistent rainfall are two impacts that place further pressure on natural resources. Areas receiving less rainfall will most likely suffer drought and fires, while other areas will face more frequent floods of greater magnitude. Such changes will make agriculture difficult and reduce productivity. It will also lead to increased problems with wildlife as fewer resources mean animals push into human settlements.

### %THREATS: COMPETING FOR LAND AND WATER USE

Development in Namibia is linked to its natural resources: land, water, minerals and wildlife. Agriculture, mining and tourism are the backbone of Namibia’s economy. They also compete for the right to use limited water and land resources. In this dry landscape, water is vitally important, and sustainable water use is a big challenge. The communal conservancy program has demonstrated that wildlife provides economic benefits, but this system must be recognized by national policy makers to be as significant as livestock or crops. Without this national support, Namibia’s land is at risk of being developed unsustainably.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

WWF’s work in Namibia focuses on supporting their communal conservancy program—a successful model for balancing the needs of people and wildlife. We partner with local communities to help them manage their natural resources and ensure a future that includes healthy wildlife populations and sustainable economic growth. Today, there is a direct relationship between the health of wildlife populations and prosperity of local communities. As a result, poaching has declined dramatically and there are now restored populations of numerous species. Building off of the success of the conservancy program, we now partner with governments and other entities to conserve biodiversity across large landscapes made up of conservancies, national parks, other state-managed protected areas, and private land.

They are:

- IMPROVING LIVELIHOODS
- PROTECTING SPECIES
- CONNECTING ECOSYSTEMS
- MITIGATING HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICTS
- GROWING ECOTOURISM
- ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE
- CONSERVATION BEYOND BORDERS

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: IMPROVING LIVELIHOODS

Namibia’s communal conservancy program aims to improve the livelihoods of rural people through the sustainable use of natural resources. WWF continues to support this program, so that local communities see the value of wildlife and benefit from maintaining healthy populations of species.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING SPECIES

WWF works closely with the Namibian government and other partners to monitor, research and protect its wildlife. We have worked together to develop innovative new transmitters to track rhino movements. We also have provided antipoaching tools and technology, such as a rhino hotline, to protect them against poaching. The SMS hotline allows individuals who are aware of rhino poaching to contact authorities safely and anonymously. WWF also assists the government in monitoring the rhino population of Etosha National Park, the largest stronghold for black rhinos in Africa.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CONNECTING ECOSYSTEMS

We have used satellite collars to study the movements of numerous animals and better understand the connectivity of ecosystems within KAZA, an enormous conservation area shared by five countries. This information has helped the government and communal conservancies identify priority areas to protect as animal movement corridors.

Studying the movement and habitat requirements of large predators – such as lions, spotted hyena, wild dogs and crocodiles – helps to better mitigate human-wildlife conflict and gives communities the knowledge to better understand how to coexist with these species. For example, tracking elephant movements within Namibia’s Caprivi Strip is revealing the impact of fences, roads and other barriers on elephant movement. This information is critical to effective long-term planning within KAZA.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: MITIGATING HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICTS

WWF works hard to increase community understanding of wildlife as an important natural resource worth conserving. We help mitigate conflict through simple methods, such as repellants around fields, enclosures for livestock, and protective walls around water sources. We also work with partners to create alternative water sources away from home and farming areas in order to reduce damage from elephants seeking water. Our work includes creating incentives for people to coexist with wildlife, such as income from ecotourism.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: GROWING ECOTOURISM

Lions, elephants, rhinos and cheetahs roam Namibia’s conservancy lands. To foster a growing ecotourism economy within conservancies, WWF helps find investors and offers business training to conservancy members. Joint venture lodges and campsites provide the largest overall source of benefits to conservancies. Tourism creates employment and fosters a variety of other sources of revenue, such as craft markets.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE

WWF and its partners help farmers prepare for climate change through the use of conservation agriculture and indigenous plant harvesting. We work to create sources of water for wildlife away from areas used by people. And we support communal conservancies as they build a network of connected land for wildlife to move freely in response to climate change.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CONSERVATION BEYOND BORDERS

In August 2011, Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe signed a treaty to pool their resources and reach across their borders in the name of conservation. The result is an enormous conservation area shared by all five countries called KAZA, the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. Some of Africa’s greatest natural treasures—including the Okavango Delta and Victoria Falls—are found here as well as nearly half of Africa’s elephants. This cross-border collaboration addresses the urgent threats of poaching and climate change and potentially allows wildlife to expand its range.

WWF will use the experience gained by supporting Namibia’s successful conservancy program to help communities and governments manage their resources better, assist in the development of the area as a tourist destination, and help create corridors that give wildlife the freedom to roam. As communities begin to improve the management of their own resources, there will be more opportunities for jobs and sources of income.

## %In Namibia's San community, nature is woven into every part of life

In the northeastern part of Namibia, bordering the Khaudum National Park and nestled within the KAZA landscape, lies Nyae Nyae Conservancy and Community Forest. Established in 1998, Nyae Nyae is one of the first four conservancies declared by the Namibian government. Here, in an area of about 3,500 square miles, abundant herds of elephants and wildebeest roam freely, flamingos migrate to the area’s pans, and Baobab trees stand tall as symbols of strength and tradition.

The region is home to the San community, whose legendary culture is renowned for living in harmony with nature, dating back to prehistoric times. As exceptional hunters, nature is woven into every aspect of San life. The local brandy bush is transformed into a skilfully crafted bow and spear for hunting. Beetle larvae become a potent poison for arrows, and glue from the sliver cluster leaf Terminalia is used to repair broken arrows. A simple wooden blade turns a succulent leaf into a versatile rope used for weaving traps.

The San connection with the land goes beyond survival, it is a mutually beneficial partnership between the San and the earth. Using their Indigenous knowledge, they use various trees and herbs to heal ailments from coughs to joint pain to kidney issues to snake bites. Through their time spent in the bush, they’ve come to know the land’s secrets, from which plants are good for food and which offer healing remedies. Tubers yield refreshing drinks and cleansing waters, while the sweet wild berries are perfect on-the-go snacks during long walks through the bush.

The San tradition of sharing and giving back is ingrained in everything they do. When they harvest, they do so carefully, leaving roots intact which allows for regeneration. It’s an unspoken promise to the earth that gives so much to them. Devil's claw is an important medicinal and economical plant that the San in Nyae Nyae harvest sustainably They meticulously take only part of the plant, leaving the rest to grow naturally. This ensures the plants keep thriving in their habitat. By selling the harvested Devil's Claw, the community earns money that supports their families and way of life.

With dry grass and fire sticks, men build the fires used for warmth, protection, and an ideal place to share stories. Around the crackling flames, tales reference nature and show their unbreakable bond to their environment. These stories are told to remind the young ones where they come from—the earth—and why it is important to safeguard nature’s gift and nurture the land that sustains them.

Being in the open allows creativity to flourish. A father makes toys for the village children using a bird’s feather, rope, sticks, and a small stone to crate the helicopter toy. As it is thrown upwards and dances in the air, it’s a testament to both imagination and skill, capturing the wonders that nature can create.

In Nyae Nyae, nature is more than a provider; it is an integral part of the community. The San people value this relationship and tend to it with reverence, knowing that in the circle of life, nature plays its part in caring for them, just as they care for nature. From the Baobab trees that stand tall, to the stories that warm the night air, this is a place where nature's heartbeat resonates in every breath.

## %The pangolin protectors

In the vast wilderness of Namibia’s Nyae Nyae Conservancy and Community Forest, many remarkable individuals are guardians of a mysterious and elusive creature—the pangolin. 

The San people play a vital role in protecting pangolins in the conservancy. With their Indigenous knowledge and tracking skills, and the cultural values they place on pangolins, combined with modern technology, the San help track, monitor, and collect data on pangolins to give us a better understanding of this elusive and threatened species. The information will help inform conservation management plans and reduce the trade of pangolins, while also providing direct benefits to the San including jobs, training, community education, and increased tourism.

Meet the team of pangolin rangers:

- N/aici Isak: The custodian of traditions
- Kaegece Sao: The fortuitous guardian
- Cwi Cwi: The youthful trailblazer

### %The pangolin protectors: N/aici Isak: The custodian of traditions

N/aici Isak \ai\ae, aged 53, is from the rugged Aha Hills village in Nyae Nyae. Isak's love for nature goes beyond words. For years, Isak safeguarded water points and boreholes from wildlife, thus minimizing human-wildlife conflict. He is a living testament to ancestral wisdom. His forebearers have been his greatest teachers, imparting invaluable knowledge of hunting and the use of wild plants. The land, says Isak, provides him with abundant gifts such as food, water, income, and peace of mind.

Isak joined the Pangolin Conservation Research Foundation in 2022. As a dedicated tracker, his responsibilities include monitoring and protecting pangolins. This pangolin initiative has brought transformative changes in the community, creating employment opportunities for local rangers who use their Indigenous knowledge to conserve wildlife. Isak’s smile radiates when he talks about his work. "I feel happy because I get some income, and I can support my family," he says.

Beyond income, pangolin conservation resonates deeply with Isak. "Pangolins are important because they are part of our environment; we have to save these animals," he says passionately. There are many myths and beliefs surrounding the pangolin, but contrary to local beliefs, Isak hasn’t heard them whistle before. Instead, he's watched them walk gracefully on their hind legs.

"I like to walk around in nature," he remarks; a simple statement that belies his connection to nature and countless journeys across the region. On average, Isak walks about 6.2 miles a day tracking pangolin. He walks without a GPS, and when asked how he knows it’s 6.2 miles, he says that he is guided by instinct and ancestral teachings. He recalls an old saying that when your legs grow weary, you have traveled 6.2 miles.

Beyond tracking, Isak’s mission is to instill a deep love for nature and wildlife conservation in young hearts. "Young people should conserve nature and learn how to live with animals," he emphasizes. He's determined to ensure that his ancestral knowledge is passed down through generations, bridging the gap between tradition and modern living.

### %The pangolin protectors: Kaegece Sao: The fortuitous guardian

The journey of Kaegece Sao, a 32-year-old pangolin tracker from Aha Hills, paints a vivid picture of resilience and adaptability. In Kaegece’s pre-ranger days, he served as a home-base care facilitator for HIV-AIDS patients, a security guard, a petrol attendant, and even a Ju/'Hoansi literacy promoter in his community.

In August 2022, Kaegece joined the Pangolin Conservation Research Foundation. His choice as a tracker was no accident; his ability to provide accurate information on pangolin locations set him apart. Kaegece acknowledges the change within the community since the arrival of the foundation, which introduced employment opportunities, provided clothing donations, and even attracted tourists to the area. As one of the first pangolin rangers in the area, he takes pride in shaping the future for both people and wildlife. Kaegece envisions a future where at least two people will be employed as pangolin rangers from each of the 28 villages in Nyae Nyae Conservancy. For Kaegece it's about more than just jobs. It's about conserving nature that takes care of us and preserving ancestral wisdom.

His face lights up when he talks about the beliefs surrounding pangolins. "When you come across a pangolin, you are considered lucky," he says. Emphasizing the importance of harmony among rangers as they track for pangolins he adds, “If you are in bad spirits, it won’t be easy for you to find the pangolin, but if you are in good spirits, it’s easy for you to find one.”

### %The pangolin protectors: Cwi Cwi: The youthful trailblazer

Cwi Cwi is a vibrant 23-year-old, brimming with youthful energy. His journey into the world of tracking is a fusion of traditions. "My tracking skills were different from the others who grew up here because I was raised in Kavango and they hunt and track differently," he says. Learning from his peers in Nyae Nyae, he now embodies the San way of tracking.

For Cwi the wilderness represents freedom and wonder, "When I am out in nature, I feel free to see the wildlife, which is amazing and attractive. Unlike the busy and noisy city, here, nature tells you about its secrets in quietness.”

Cwi joined the team of pangolin rangers in 2021, and as the youngest of the team, Cwi absorbs knowledge like a sponge, learning the art of tracking and how to use telemetry. He's not just a tracker; he also raises awareness about these remarkable creatures and ensures that future generations have the privilege of witnessing the magnificence of the pangolin.

In the wilderness, where darkness meets stillness, Cwi has learned that fear has no place. "I used to be scared at first but now I'm not scared,” he says, recounting nights spent tracking. Living in harmony with wildlife is a lesson he holds dear. "It feels good having the animals around us, as long as we do not bother them because if you bother them, they will bother you," he observes wisely.

Cwi' is driven by passion and purpose. "The reason I'm caring for the pangolin is because I want the future generation to see this beautiful and shy animal," he says.

In Nyae Nyae, the pangolins stay hidden, but in the heart of these guardians, the hope for their survival burns brightly. The wilderness echoes with their footsteps and a legacy of unwavering dedication to nature.

## %BIG DATA - IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, FIVE COUNTRIES UNITED BY A SHARED VISION FOR CONSERVATION UNDERTAKE AN ELEPHANT SURVEY OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS

Netsai Bollmann knows what it’s like to coexist with elephants.

In the course of her work in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, known as KAZA, Bollmann frequently drives from her home in Botswana to Victoria Falls on the Zambia-Zimbabwe border. More often than not, she yields the right of way to the giant gray pachyderms.

“Sometimes it’s a lot of them, and you wait for them to cross, or sometimes you try to push your way through,” she says. Once, she arrived home after work to find an elephant had wandered into her yard; someone had left the gate to the property open. Her neighbor herded it out with his old 4x4.

“There’s nowhere in KAZA that you will not see elephants,” she says. “They’re everywhere. They’re part of our lives.”

Carved out of the convergence of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, KAZA is the largest terrestrial transboundary conservation area in the world. Bigger than California, the 200,000-square-mile area encompasses three World Heritage Sites and numerous national parks, forest reserves, and other conservation areas. It’s also home to about 2.6 million people and approximately half of Africa’s remaining savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana).

And while the African savanna elephant is officially listed as endangered, numbers in KAZA appear to be stable or increasing. Past survey data indicates that around 220,000 roam this biologically rich landscape. That’s about one six-ton herbivore per square mile—or one for every 12 people living in KAZA.

“It’s a lot of people,” says Bollmann, “and it’s a lot of wildlife.”

With agriculture, homes, and kids going to school, interactions aren’t always as benign as an elephant lolling in the garden. “Human-wildlife conflict is a real problem,” she says, “with sometimes severe consequences.”

When the five countries established KAZA in 2011, they envisioned conservation and tourism driving the region’s economy, with communities playing a critical role as both stewards and beneficiaries of wildlife. But coordinating conservation efforts across this immense landscape and among multiple countries is an ongoing challenge.

Exacerbating that challenge has been a lack of reliable data about wildlife populations. “Without a good understanding of where the elephants are, and what their numbers are, you’re planning in the dark,” Bollmann says.

In 2022, she was part of a team that set out to help fill that knowledge gap. As the program manager of the KAZA Secretariat, the entity charged with administering the countries’ shared agenda, she helped facilitate a monumental effort to determine the number and seasonal distribution of savanna elephants in KAZA.

With technical and financial input from WWF, and with support from a global pool of donors and partners (see page 28), in August 2022 a 47-person team—including pilots, biologists, and data analysts—launched what they hoped would be a definitive aerial survey.

As Bollmann well knew, pulling it off would be no small feat. “Honestly,” she says, “I’m 41, and I have developed two white hairs since I joined KAZA. One of them is from the beginning of the survey.”

### %BIG DATA - IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, FIVE COUNTRIES UNITED BY A SHARED VISION FOR CONSERVATION UNDERTAKE AN ELEPHANT SURVEY OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS: Mutual goals

When it comes to protecting the largest viable and contiguous population of elephants in Africa, the KAZA partner countries “do not take lightly the responsibility they carry for— and on behalf of—the rest of the world,” says Nyambe Nyambe, executive director of the KAZA Secretariat, adding that the goal is “a thriving, wild population.”

Meeting that responsibility requires addressing a host of issues—not least, ensuring elephants have room to roam. The largest land mammals on Earth often range over huge distances, oblivious to national borders as they search for water, food, and mates. Because they need so much space, landscape-level planning and transboundary cooperation among KAZA’s countries are essential to the species’ survival—and that of many other species, too.

Having up-to-date population numbers—as well as a clearer picture of when and where the animals move, especially between protected areas—will enable better coordination and allow partner countries to make more informed decisions, says Nyambe.

With more accurate data, he explains, conservationists can pinpoint where greater efforts are needed to secure wildlife dispersal areas—key corridors that allow elephants to move across the landscape—or to remove or reevaluate barriers that prevent the animals from migrating freely. Better data will also identify where to scale up efforts to help communities deal with large numbers of elephants.

“Currently the largest elephant populations are in Botswana and Zimbabwe, and these two countries are facing significant pressure from human-elephant conflict,” says Nyambe. “How can we deal with it? KAZA provides an opportunity for elephants to move from areas of local overpopulation to areas of local underpopulation.” (Following decades of war and poaching, numbers are especially low in parts of Zambia and Angola.)

At the same time, updated numbers will help KAZA partner countries know where to invest in tourism.

“From a tourism perspective, we’ve got thousands of beds across the KAZA landscape,” says Bollmann, who spent 14 years in regional tourism development before joining the KAZA Secretariat. Ecotourism is a significant contributor to the economies of partner countries. Knowing more about elephants will further develop the wildlife economy—and allow the people of KAZA to not only put food on the table but also enjoy “opportunities for real, meaningful quality of life,” she says.

For those reasons and more, in 2019 the five countries agreed that a count of elephants in KAZA was long overdue.

### %BIG DATA - IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, FIVE COUNTRIES UNITED BY A SHARED VISION FOR CONSERVATION UNDERTAKE AN ELEPHANT SURVEY OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS: Surveying giants

The last major elephant survey in Africa took place from 2013 to 2016. Known as the Great Elephant Census (GEC), it was audacious in scope, involving more than 90 scientists and 286 crew members representing 18 countries.

The census painted a broad-strokes picture of astonishing loss, identifying a 30% decline in the total savanna elephant population across the continent in just seven years—largely a result of poaching for elephant ivory, human-wildlife conflict, and war. Even in KAZA, the largest savanna elephant stronghold, researchers found pockets of what they called “catastrophic” declines: The Sebungwe Region of northwest Zimbabwe, for example, suffered a 75% loss between 2006 and 2014.

These findings drew global attention to the plight of Africa’s elephants. They also proved that a census of such massive scale was possible, says WWF-Namibia’s Russell Taylor, the conservation planning advisor and veteran biologist who served as technical lead in developing the KAZA survey. “We learned a lot from the GEC,” he says, citing the importance of securing government support and ownership, taking a team approach, and being flexible, nimble, and able to make timely decisions.

However, “there was no synchronization of the sort that we know should happen,” says Taylor, and “no cross-border coordination, although attempts were made.” In KAZA, the GEC surveyed Angola, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (and WWF funded an independent survey of Namibia). But the counts were done at different times and in different years, meaning some elephants may have been tallied two or more times and others not at all as they moved across international borders.

When in May 2019 the KAZA partner countries decided to undertake a KAZA-wide, synchronized aerial survey, it was a key part of a larger strategy to shore up the elephant population amid an epidemic of wildlife crime. Despite the countries’ commitment to conserving elephants, until then they hadn’t agreed on a means to that end. More precise data was needed to help them make tough decisions.

The survey was planned as a two-year project. (“A plan is nothing; planning is everything,” quips Taylor.) By October 2019, the team had developed its design, but the COVID-19 pandemic soon wreaked havoc on the timeline. Once it was safe to move forward, the organizing partners realized they’d need to hit the ground running to complete the count in 2022. Though the surveying would last only two months, timing was key. In July 2022, the team led a weeklong workshop to select and train observers.

“We were working against a tight timeline linked to the weather and climatic conditions,” Nyambe explains. In the dry months of August, September, and October, most trees and shrubs are leafless, making it easier to see wildlife from the air. Moreover, when it’s dry, normally peripatetic pachyderms mostly stay put around permanent water sources. When the first rains come, however, seasonal pans are replenished, luring them to fresh water and forage, and “elephants start moving all over the place,” Nyambe says.

### %BIG DATA - IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, FIVE COUNTRIES UNITED BY A SHARED VISION FOR CONSERVATION UNDERTAKE AN ELEPHANT SURVEY OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS: Bird’s-eye view

Toward the end of the dry season, strong winds and bush fires in Zimbabwe’s Sebungwe Region generally create poor visibility and extremely hazardous flying conditions. But on August 22, 2022, it was calm and clear as a six-seater Cessna 206 bush plane took to the skies about an hour after sunrise from an airstrip near Matusadona National Park.

The pilot did his best to hug the rugged terrain below, balancing safety with optimal height for viewing elephants. Two observers called out sightings—creating an audio recording over the voice-triggered intercom—while a fourth crew member logged them using a GPS unit and handwritten notes. The plane returned safely to the airstrip at 11 am sharp.

Over the next several weeks, a series of carefully synchronized, often simultaneous, flights traversed the expanse of the KAZA landscape, from Botswana’s Okavango Delta to Zambia’s Kafue National Park and Victoria Falls. As the planes flew above scrubby savannas, vast grasslands, and snaking rivers, each crew followed a rigorous and methodical approach.

Darren Potgieter, an experienced wildlife surveyor who led the field effort, says crews observed the aerial survey standards set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) called MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants). Using this widely adopted method, they mostly conducted transect sample counts, flying in straight, evenly spaced lines over relatively flat ground, with observers counting elephants in a carefully calibrated field of view. In areas where maintaining a consistent height over precipitous peaks and hidden gorges wasn’t possible, teams performed block counts.

Flights took place in the early mornings—before temperatures in the planes would become unbearable and wildlife on the ground would seek shade. To ensure maximum visibility, pilots flew low and slow, with a search rate of one square kilometer per minute. “That’s part of the rigor we built into the survey,” says Taylor. “We control the height; we control the speed. You can’t go much slower, else you’ll crash.”

Because of the complex, sometimes dangerous nature of the work, flight crews comprised highly trained, thoroughly vetted experts. Each included a skilled pilot not only capable of low-level flying—with its greater risk of collisions and reduced time to recover after stalls or engine failures—but also able to take off from and land in treacherous terrain. Crews were chosen for their ability to accurately identify species, their visual acuity (“We bought one man a pair of glasses,” says Taylor), and their fortitude to endure hot, bumpy flights that could stretch to nearly four hours.

Longer than that, and crew fatigue would lead to bad data, Potgieter says.

“I’m not ashamed to say I did not participate,” Bollmann says, deadpan. “Once that flight takes off, it doesn’t matter how sick you get on that plane. It’s not gonna land—because it can’t. Otherwise it compromises the count. There was nothing anyone was going to do to get me on one of those planes.”

### %BIG DATA - IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, FIVE COUNTRIES UNITED BY A SHARED VISION FOR CONSERVATION UNDERTAKE AN ELEPHANT SURVEY OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS: Heartbeat of coordination

Happily grounded, Bollmann oversaw myriad logistics, including organizing meetings to apprise ministries, donors, and partners of progress and setbacks, supporting the team in procuring aircraft, and purchasing fuel and equipment to keep as many as six planes aloft at one time.

Logistics also included the arduous task of securing the overflight permits from each country that would allow for tightly synchronized flights. To avoid the risk of over-or undercounting elephants, the survey was designed to minimize the flight time over areas where the animals frequently crisscross international borders—between Botswana and Zimbabwe, for example.

That meant obtaining and submitting copious documentation to civil aviation authorities, such as permission letters from every airstrip and details about each flight’s aircraft and crew.

Acquiring the overflight permits made for some “sleepless nights and restless days,” says Nyambe.

Bollmann concurs. In fact, she blames her second white hair on them: “Now for the rest of my life, it will remind me of the elephants,” she says with a laugh.

The government of Botswana loaned the project an operations room that Potgieter called the heartbeat of coordination. Based in Kasane, the former parks authority conference room had been used as a storeroom before Bollmann supervised its rebirth as the survey’s data hub. Four days before the first flight, it was up and running, with reliable electricity and internet, and a row of workstations with two big wall-mounted monitors and an even bigger 2022 calendar—a constant reminder of the short window to pull off the survey.

There, Potgieter’s colleague Elsa Bussière, the survey’s science and technology manager, presided over six data analysts borrowed from the KAZA partner countries. Their inclusion was one way to ensure transparency, Potgieter says.

As permits were granted and flights got underway, satellite technology allowed the ops room to monitor the trajectory, height, and speed of every aircraft in near real time. The data came pouring in, and the analysts began the monthslong process of making sense of it all.

### %BIG DATA - IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, FIVE COUNTRIES UNITED BY A SHARED VISION FOR CONSERVATION UNDERTAKE AN ELEPHANT SURVEY OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS: Getting to ‘Yes’

For those involved in the survey, anticipating obstacles and responding to setbacks often felt like playing a game of Whac-A-Mole. Data might be corrupted or poorly recorded, meaning extra work in the ops room to validate it. Potential mechanical failures, meanwhile, were always top of mind.

“A couple of days’ downtime because you’ve got an aircraft engine problem, or a propeller problem, or an alternator problem? ... You can’t afford to lose those days,” says Taylor.

Another challenge: ensuring all five KAZA partner countries were kept well-informed so they could provide input and approvals along the way. Bollmann explains that it was crucial at each step to get five yeses to ensure everyone remained fully supportive as plans evolved.

Given the vagaries of weather and wildlife, flexibility and adaptability were crucial, and their detailed plan anticipated challenges, allowing for go and no-go moments.

“We were prepared to say, ‘If this is not done by this day, then we cannot proceed,’” says Nyambe. “There were challenges, trust me. But everybody rallied together. The level of cooperation was amazing.”

### %BIG DATA - IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, FIVE COUNTRIES UNITED BY A SHARED VISION FOR CONSERVATION UNDERTAKE AN ELEPHANT SURVEY OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS: Crunching the numbers

In the end, the team had clocked almost 700 flying hours covering the nearly 121,000 square miles where 99% of KAZA’s elephants live.

“When that last flight took place, we all breathed a little,” says Bollmann.

With the final data in hand, Potgieter and Bussière spent the next several months crunching numbers to share with the KAZA partner countries and to be scrutinized by external independent reviewers before the results were officially released to the world.

Their report, released in August 2023, was encouraging: It estimated a total of 227,900 elephants in KAZA, indicating a stable population. It also identified high elephant mortality in certain regions, underscoring a need for further research, monitoring, and tailored conservation initiatives—findings that reinforce recommendations made in the KAZA Elephant Sub Working Group’s latest policy brief, which provides guidance on securing and maintaining elephant movement corridors and landscape connectivity.

Both the results and the survey itself were sources of pride for all involved. “I’ve not known a better-executed survey,” says Taylor.

Moreover, knowing that these countries could come together to complete such an enormous project gives Bollmann hope for their ability to protect the future of elephants.

“The five countries made a decision that they’re going to pull off something that was going to be a remarkable challenge, and they did it together,” says Bollmann. “They prioritized it, they planned together, they dealt with challenges together.... To see them working together and being a part of that—as an African person from Southern Africa—made me very proud.”

## %Behati Prinsloo Levine on the magic of Namibia’s black rhinos—and what we can do to save them

Climbing sand dunes as tall as the Empire State Building, running around a meteorite that fell from the sky about 80,000 years ago, and fishing in the ice-cold waters of the Skeleton Coast are just some of the magical moments I had growing up in Namibia.

And then there is Etosha National Park, the most wonderful place of all. When I was a kid, marking days off the calendar until school holidays arrived, I knew that each day took me closer to Etosha. My mom, dad, and I would load the car with food and camping equipment and set out on an adventure to the park!

Banded mongoose scurried across the grounds at Namutoni campsite. A warthog plowed its way through the grass at Okaukuejo, Etosha's main camp, and there were black rhinos shuffling to the flood-lit waterholes at night. I remember the sounds and the smells and was in awe knowing that this was their home and mine.

I live a world away from Etosha now, but this feeling is still with me. A few years ago, when I was back in Etosha, I found that the park is still magical, and behind the scenes, the Ministry of Environment Forestry and Tourism is working hard to keep it that way.

Namibia is home to the largest population of black rhinos left on earth. The rhinos from Etosha are the donor population for many innovative and successful efforts to expand the range and number of rhinos nationwide. But this success makes Etosha and its rhinos a target for armed poachers and international wildlife crime syndicates that kill them for their horns.

In February of this year, Namibia reported a rhino poaching surge of 93%, mainly in Etosha. With attention focused on the park, the poachers have disappeared into the darkness. But one thing is certain: they will be back, and we must be ready.

As a Nambian, I am incredibly proud to know that Etosha's K9 protection unit is expanding, the horseback patrols are returning to the park, and that high-tech surveillance equipment is being deployed to monitor areas that have become poaching "hot spots." Additional resources are also being provided to the Wildlife Protection Services, the skilled team that spends days and nights in the field protecting rhinos. They need to know that we value them as much as we value rhinos.

As we approach World Rhino Day on Sept. 22, please join me in supporting these efforts. WWF is trying to raise $250,000 in support of the Namibian government's urgent antipoaching plan in Etosha National Park. This includes training a sniffer dog unit to track poachers, building housing for the Wildlife Protection Service, and establishing a horse patrol unit to help rangers monitor the park's remote areas. We need your help to make it happen.

Etosha is still a place of wonder, and with your help, together we can keep it that way.

## %SHARING SPACE

The sounds of squabbling baboons and squawking guinea fowl greet Tjavarekua Tjijahura as she rises to prepare breakfast and break camp. She is wearing the traditional clothes of Ovaherero women—petticoats, a voluminous dress with vibrant patterns, and a hornlike headscarf that pays homage to part of her identity: The Ovaherero people are historically cattle breeders, and raising livestock is a common way of life.

While the campsite is far from Tjijahura’s village, she says she feels an affinity for this vast landscape. Like many Namibians, she grew up surrounded by wild places and wild animals.

“Although we have cattle, we have always lived as conservationists,” Tjijahura says.

Nature, it’s clear, is home.

This is not the first time that Tjijahura has traveled through this landscape, which local communities are working to include in the land they have set aside for wildlife as part of a larger vision for conservation and community development. A few years ago, a trip here inspired her and a handful of others to organize themselves into an action group, Women for Conservation, to participate in this historic venture. Now she’s returning to discuss this bold vision with them at the Ehi-Rovipuka Conservancy office.

The big idea? Establish support for a wildlife corridor between the Skeleton Coast, where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic, and the vast Etosha National Park some 100 miles inland. The vision is to provide for the free movement of wildlife, shore up the viability of a cherished way of life, and create new opportunities for communities—women included—to benefit financially from the land they have chosen to protect. “The landscape already exists,” says Tjijahura. “The corridor from Etosha to the coast has always been there.”

The Ovaherero experience of human-wildlife coexistence is far from unique in Namibia. When the country gained independence from South Africa in 1990, protection of the environment was enshrined in the constitution—and included the sustainable use of Namibia’s natural resources for the benefit of all Namibians. In 1996 the Nature Conservation Amendment Act put the rights to, and responsibilities for, conserving wildlife in the hands of the communities living with it. The ground-breaking law emphasized local control and encouraged communities to organize themselves as conservancies to manage and benefit from wildlife on their communal lands.

In the decades that followed, the conservancy model flourished and conservancies multiplied. Today there are 86 conservancies covering nearly 65,000 square miles, or 20% of Namibia—the highest percentage of community management in a single nation worldwide. The country’s wildlife populations, from critically endangered black rhinos to desert-adapted lions, have contributed to a tourism economy that employs thousands and generates more than 14% of Namibia’s GDP. WWF has supported the conservancy program for more than 25 years.

At the confluence of two dry riverbeds, two conservancy leaders meet to talk about community collaboration. Siegfried Muzuma is the chair of the Ehi-Rovipuka Conservancy, whose communal lands form the western border of Etosha National Park. Gustav Tjiundukamba is chair of the Omatendeka Conservancy, whose lands are one step closer to the Skeleton Coast.

“We formed our conservancies at the same time,” says Tjiundukamba, “and we have the same goals.” He is nodding as he speaks, and Muzuma jumps in to add, “Joint management means stronger conservation outcomes.”

“These communities have taken the important next step of comanaging their core wildlife areas and becoming partners in the effort to include these areas in the expansive conservation landscape that links the Skeleton Coast to Etosha,” says Juliane Zeidler, country director for WWF-Namibia.

The region hosts much of the country’s desert-adapted elephant population and the only increasing giraffe population outside a protected area in Africa, not to mention a growing black rhino population.

Recognizing the opportunity to team up for greater landscape connectivity, the men met with members of their respective communities, heard voices of support and dissent, and joined with the majority in advocating for consolidation of their core wildlife areas to form the proposed Ombonde People’s Park.

Working alongside the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, and with the support of WWF and a host of other organizations, the conservancies hope to secure the legal status of Ombonde and, in doing so, establish their right to control access to defined wildlife areas. At present, unguided cross-country tourists drive through for free. Establishing tourism zones to which the conservancies have sole management rights, says Muzuma, would bring in much-needed jobs and development and “change the living standard of the people on the ground.” In addition, under the future park’s management plan, community members would continue to be able to use the area for emergency livestock grazing in the event of drought—a constant threat in this arid landscape.

Chief Kenamurire Kasaona, a traditional leader, conservancy member, and liaison for Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation (IRDNC)—an NGO that has played a leading role in establishing and supporting conservancies—says he is proud of how Namibia is righting historical wrongs. In giving conservancies responsibility for managing wildlife, Namibia began to restore precolonial practices.

Under colonization, he says, game animals were officially owned by the state. Conservation efforts ignored local knowledge and excluded rural people from decision-making. This deprived the people who lived with wild animals and competed with them for water and grazing lands of the benefits of tourism, hunting, and resource use. Allowing conservancies to control access to their core wildlife zones would further empower communities and expand the conservancy model’s gains.

“The vision for this conservation area has been to ensure animals can move freely and that people can benefit from this for generations to come,” says John Kasaona, executive director of IRDNC (and a relative of the chief). His father was one of the first game guards recruited when the conservancy program was in its infancy—a poacher turned protector. “My dad, and the men he worked with, would be so happy to see what’s happened in Namibia,” he says. “They went through many hurdles for the conservancy model to get where it is now. I’m sure they are smiling, wherever they are.”

In an area known as Little Serengeti for its sprawling grasslands, craggy buttes, and deep, windswept canyons, oryx and springboks dot the wild landscape and giraffes use their long purple tongues to pluck at camel thorn leaves. “Wild animals can be hard to live with,” says Chief Kasaona. “Still, people want them here. They want measures in place to prevent [human-wildlife] conflict. But they don’t want the animals to be taken away.”

Lions pose a particular challenge. Following the advent of Namibia’s conservancy system, the lion population increased nearly fourfold (after nosediving for much of the 20th century). Although their population numbers fluctuate, the big cats’ range has expanded. A recent prolonged drought has thrust wildlife and livestock into ever-closer proximity, and close quarters can spark conflict: Lions, hyenas, and other predators have been responsible for thousands of livestock attacks. Retaliatory killings are the number one cause of mortality for juvenile and adult lions in northwest Namibia.

In a village near the proposed Ombonde park, Himba herder Tjimbali Kamendu lives a simple life in a mud-daubed hut not far from the folds and whorls of one of the ephemeral rivers that offer vegetated pathways through the landscape. Kamendu spends his days watching over his goats in the veld or taking them to the water to drink. Goats are core to people’s livelihoods here; Kamendu says he knows immediately if one is missing.

This is where the Lion Rangers, conservancy-employed game guards, come in. Working with researchers and the government, rangers proactively manage conflict by fitting lions with collars that communicate with receptors in villages. This early-warning system alerts villagers when lions are nearby and allows them to track how close the lions are and in which direction they’re moving; in addition, solar-powered lights and sirens keep lions away from livestock kraals.

“The farmers are feeling very good about this system in terms of preventing livestock losses by knowing when there is a collared lion around,” says ranger Jendery Tsaneb. He says farmers have become critical partners who help them do their job by sharing information. “If they see a lion which is not collared, they tell us,” he says.

Perhaps the best example of Namibians’ willingness to protect their wildlife? The black rhino. Today, Africa’s largest free-roaming population moves throughout northwestern Namibia’s Kunene Region, where the rhinos are found not only in traditional protected areas like Etosha National Park (the rhinos’ heartland) but also on community lands, under the watch of conservancies. “It’s the only place in the world where you get free-roaming black rhinos living amongst communities,” says Simson Uri-Khob, CEO of Save the Rhino Trust.

The trust is one of the oldest black rhino conservation groups and the only one with an agreement with the government to monitor the population and conduct research on black rhinos in the remote Kunene Region. The group pioneered the strategy of putting the well-being of black rhinos in the hands of communities that live with them, and it’s paid off. In the area where the trust operates, black rhino numbers have increased threefold over three decades. The rhino’s range has also expanded, and people will pay to see them. “Now that [people] get benefits directly from the rhinos, they are proud to have them here and to protect them,” says Uri-Khob.

For some, protecting rhinos has become central to both life and livelihood. The men and women employed as rangers in the region are masters at tracking the animals in their arid, hardscrabble home. It’s boot-stripping, tire-tearing terrain, but rangers move across the landscape with apparent ease, fluent in the language of the rhino—an overturned rock here, some rhino- or oryx-browsed euphorbia there.

Sebulon Hoëb began working for Save the Rhino Trust 33 years ago, and his son, Hofney Gaseb, has followed his lead. “I could track a rhino before I could read,” says Gaseb, recalling his days as a young child in the field with his father and brother. While on patrol for up to 21 days at a time, rangers photograph each rhino they see, feeding a database that informs management decisions. Committed rangers are recognized at annual award ceremonies, can earn performance-related cash bonuses, and vie for the coveted title of “Rhino Hero,” which comes with a bomber jacket for colder months.

In fact, there’s a whole culture developing around black rhino conservation through initiatives like an annual rhino pride march, a rhino conservation-branded soccer league, and early literacy projects that elevate the animals in the eyes of rural Namibians.

“We feel like the rhinos are our children,” says Hoëb, proud of how his work has supported his family and community and cemented deep ties to the wild land he loves. Equally important? Rhinos draw tourists; their presence creates jobs and generates income. Hoëb’s other son, Rodney, is a rhino guide.

“If you don’t have communities on your side in conservation, there is no hope for you,” says Save the Rhino Trust’s Uri-Khob. “We know the people we employ, and the traditional authorities know them. The communities know them. It’s kids growing up in the communities who keep these rhinos alive.”

Just two years ago, he says, a poaching syndicate from up north came into one of the patrolled areas.

“Before they came in, the communities already knew about them,” says Uri-Khob. “The poachers were arrested before they could do any harm.”

Poaching is just one of the challenges conservancies face. In the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic showed that relying on tourism alone to fund conservancies leaves them vulnerable to disruptive events that impact global travel. At the same time, the prolonged drought has increased conflict over grazing lands and water and wiped out large numbers of livestock and wildlife, including rhino calves.

Satisfaction with conservancies varies from area to area, depending on the level of local engagement, how much revenue is generated, and how it’s shared. Conservancies with more wildlife or the most spectacular scenery may find it easier to make money from tourism, for example. Even with this new vision for the Skeleton Coast-to-Etosha land bridge, and the gains the Ombonde People’s Park could provide, not everyone benefits equally, and some feel they don’t benefit at all. Yet more than three decades of community-based natural resource management have proven the value of working through such challenges together.

“Now we have a whole landscape of conservancies with the same ambition coming together in this area,” says Maxi Louis, director of the Namibian Association of Community-Based Natural Resource Management Support Organizations. “And when conservancies come together institutionally,” she adds, “you are addressing many issues at scale”—including wildlife management, human-wildlife conflict, governance, poaching, and gender equity.

At the Ehi-Rovipuka Conservancy office, Tjavarekua Tjijahura and 16 Women for Conservation members gather to discuss the proposed park.

It has been four years since she was first inspired by the landscape and its tourism potential, and it’s clear that she relishes her role not only as chair of the group but also as an advocate for her culture and women’s inclusion.

“The [vision for this initiative] provoked me to stand up and tell the women that we can play a bigger role. Although women have been left behind, once they take something up, they take it up with both hands,” she says.

“We are the caregivers who make sure the children are fed and go to school,” adds conservancy member Linda Kavetu. “Why shouldn’t we contribute more to conservation and tourism? It will create jobs for our children.”

Another member, Tuaendasanavi Ruhamba, nods in agreement as she cradles a child in her lap. The baby was born when the discussion around creating this large, linked landscape was at its height. Taking the chubby six-month-old into her arms, Tjijahura smiles and gives him a little jiggle.

“This little one is called Uekerondavi,” she says. “His name means ‘landscape.’”
