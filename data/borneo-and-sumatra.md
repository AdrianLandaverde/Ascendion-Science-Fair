# %BORNEO AND SUMATRA

The forests of Borneo and Sumatra are among the most biologically diverse habitats on Earth, possessing staggeringly high numbers of unique plants and animals.

The Southeast Asian islands of Borneo and Sumatra, located on the Equator, are home to some of the world’s most diverse rain forests and Southeast Asia’s last intact forests. Borneo is the world’s third largest island, covering an area slightly larger than Texas. Sumatra is the world’s sixth largest island. The islands’ tropical climate and diverse ecoregions have created habitats that house thousands of unique species and the world’s last remaining Sumatran tigers, orangutans, Bornean elephants, and Sumatran rhinos. Massive rivers cut across the landscape. These are the islands’ lifelines, offering transport and providing the freshwater needs for the islands’ people.

CONTINENT: Asia
SPECIES: Orangutan, Sumatran rhino, Bornean elephant, Sumatran tiger, Sumatran elephant

## %SPECIES

Sumatra is the only place on Earth where tigers, rhinos, orangutans, and elephants live together. The forests of Borneo and Sumatra are home to marvelous creatures like the proboscis monkey, sun bear, clouded leopard, and flying fox bat, and endangered animals like the Sumatran tiger, Sumatran rhino, and Bornean elephant.

There are more than 15,000 known plants here, with many more species yet to be discovered. Since 1995, more than 400 species have been identified on the islands, with more than 50 of these species completely new to science. An unknown mammal species—for now dubbed the Bornean red carnivore—was photographed by one of WWF’s camera traps in 2003.

The main species are:

- SUMATRAN ORANGUTAN
- SUMATRAN RHINO
- BORNEAN ORANGUTAN
- RHINO
- BORNEAN ELEPHANT
- SUMATRAN ELEPHANT

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

The cultural diversity of Borneo and Sumatra is as distinct and varied as its plant life. More than 60 million people live on these two islands. They are a mix of indigenous peoples and immigrants from other islands in Indonesia, such as Java, as well as other Asian countries. The current population of Borneo is estimated at 18 million. Sumatra is home to 50 million people and is the world's fourth most populous island.

Rapid economic changes have brought shifts in population and threaten the way of life for communities who have traditionally lived off the forest. Borneo's native cultures are usually referred to collectively as "Dayak," a term that covers a multitude of ethnic groups. Sumatra is also home to a variety of ethnic groups, including the Batak, Minangkabau, Krui, and Pelalawan-Petalangan.

## %THREATS

In Borneo and Sumatra, the vast wealth of natural resources has attracted large-scale international financing focused on extractive industries, from precious hardwoods and minerals to palm oil, rubber, and coal.

The main threats are:

- UNSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
- DEFORESTATION
- ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

### %THREATS: UNSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

Expanding oil palm plantations and, in Sumatra, coffee cultivation is encroaching on landscapes crucial to species conservation.

### %THREATS: DEFORESTATION

Indonesia is home to approximately three percent of the world's forests. Yet deforestation in this region represents over a third of the total global carbon emissions from deforestation and land degradation. Heavy demand for plywood, hardwoods, and wood products for the pulp and paper industry leads to both legal and illegal logging.

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

Wildlife trade is a major problem in this region. Rampant poaching, facilitated by the growing number of roads and logging trails, poses a grave threat to Borneo and Sumatra's endangered species like tigers and rhinos.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

In Borneo and Sumatra WWF works with local communities and governments and uses global action to address the relentless forces that are destroying the last strongholds of elephants, orangutans, and other species. 

They are:

- SAFEGUARDING SUMATRA’S SPECIES
- ENABLING RESPONSIBLE FORESTRY
- PRACTICING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
- PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY
- PROTECTING THE HEART OF BORNEO

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: SAFEGUARDING SUMATRA’S SPECIES

WWF collaborates with local communities, industry, and governments to alleviate human-wildlife conflict by improving enforcement and providing alternate income opportunities for local people.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ENABLING RESPONSIBLE FORESTRY

Approximately three-quarters of Indonesia’s timber is illegally harvested. WWF assists producers and traders, educates consumers, and works with partners to enable responsible forestry and restore local communities.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PRACTICING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

Palm oil coming from Borneo and Sumatra accounts for more than half of all palm oil produced in the world. WWF co-founded the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil in 2003, a collaborative group working to bring sustainable palm oil to the marketplace and reform land use practices.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY

Deforestation in Indonesia is often driven by indiscriminate land-grabbing, corruption and lack of law enforcement. WWF co-founded Eyes on the Forest (EoF) — an alliance that includes WWF, Friends of the Earth and the Forest Rescue Network Riau — to monitor the status of the remaining natural forests in Sumatra's province of Riau and share information worldwide to empower those working to protect critical habitat.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING THE HEART OF BORNEO

WWF is implementing a collaborative conservation plan with the governments of Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, and Malaysia to protect the Heart of Borneo—a pristine area of equatorial rain forests larger than Kansas.

## %An iconic forest, protected and returning

Between 1985 and 2014, a wide swath of Sumatra’s forested land—called Bukit Tigapuluh or Thirty Hills—lost 32% of its forest cover because of deforestation. In 2015, PT Alam Bukit Tigapuluh (ABT)—a company founded by WWF-Indonesia, the Frankfurt Zoological Society, and The Orangutan Project—secured the right to manage nearly 100,000 acres of this land, which is home to the Indigenous Talang Mamak and Orang Rimba peoples and an abundance of wildlife species.

ABT has since managed this “ecosystem restoration concession” to protect and restore the forest while also generating revenue and livelihoods for local people. Almost eight years later, deforestation in the concession has declined considerably. But pressure on the forest and its biodiversity continues, and ABT has to remain vigilant to protect what remains.

Today, ABT collaborates with Indigenous peoples and local communities on sustainable agroforestry businesses and forest protection efforts that improve lives while protecting this stronghold for critically endangered Sumatran elephants, orangutans, and tigers.

## %INVESTING IN "THIRTY HILLS"

Deep in the heart of the Sumatran rain forest in Indonesia, a small company has a big vision. PT Alam Bukit Tigapuluh (ABT), which means The Thirty Hills Forest Company, just marked its fifth year of piloting a new approach to commercial business with a conservation mission.

Sumatra is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth, home to iconic species such as elephants, tigers, rhinos, and orangutans. But it also has one of the highest rates of deforestation on the planet, driven by high global demand for commodities like palm oil and rubber. Thirty Hills is the last large block of intact, lowland forest still standing in central Sumatra.

ABT works with the local and Indigenous communities living in Thirty Hills to conserve the forest and protect wildlife, while also working to generate revenue and income to support community livelihoods and operations. Today, ABT is managing nearly 100,000 acres of land, working as one of just 16 officially recognized “ecosystem restoration concessions” in Indonesia meant to protect and restore critical forests.

“In just five years, we have already seen great success in saving some of the most biologically diverse and important forests on our planet,” says Dody Rukman, CEO of ABT. “We have shown that there can be economic and social benefits from an intact, healthy forest and we’ll continue to work creatively to keep Thirty Hills as the crown jewel it has always been.”

5 SUCCESSES FOR 5 YEARS OF ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION IN SUMATRA, INDONESIA:

1. Giving new life to the forest
2. Partnering with the local people
3. Protecting the forest's wildlife
4. Establishing new business ventures
5. Building a self-sufficient and sustainable future

### %INVESTING IN "THIRTY HILLS": Giving new life to the forest

The rain forests of mega-biodiverse Sumatra are unlike anywhere else on Earth. Sadly, since 1985, Sumatra had lost more than half of its forests. While most companies in the area work to make money from the clearing of forests, ABT is demonstrating the financial benefits of protecting and restoring forests. ABT’s forest patrol teams and community efforts have managed to cut the annual deforestation rate by 84% within the concession. Reforestation of degraded and deforested areas has begun to restore tree cover through work with local Simerantihan villagers to establish two nurseries in the area.

### %INVESTING IN "THIRTY HILLS": Partnering with the local people

ABT’s biggest partners are the people who live within and near the forest. Five villages surround the concession, and inside the concession are 54 households from the Talang Mamak Indigenous community. Protecting Thirty Hills protects these peoples’ traditional culture and their future. ABT works with the communities to support their livelihoods. This includes identifying products from the forest that generate alternative incomes, providing monthly mobile health clinics for the Talang Mamak community, and expanding access to educational facilities, materials, and scholarships.

### %INVESTING IN "THIRTY HILLS": Protecting the forest's wildlife

This is one of the few wild places where elephants, tigers, and orangutans coexist. The forests of Thirty Hills are home to at least 120 elephants, 30 tigers, and 160 orangutans, all critically endangered. ABT and its three conservation organization founders—WWF-Indonesia, Frankfurt Zoological Society and The Orangutan Project—collaborate to tackle issues such as poaching, human-wildlife conflict, and identifying wildlife corridors to protect the wild inhabitants that depend on the forest for survival.

### %INVESTING IN "THIRTY HILLS": Establishing new business ventures

ABT’s mission is simple – create viable and sustainable alternatives to deforestation-based options. Over the past few years, ABT worked with local people to find the most promising commodities that would generate enough income to cover costs, ensure profit, and have minimum environmental impact. This includes helping the Talang Mamak expand markets for their wild-harvested honey and provide income for villagers. These honey collectors are not your average beekeepers! Using traditional methods, they bravely climb 100-foot and higher trees to retrieve the honey. ABT continues to work with the Talang Mamak to scale up their honey business and assist with marketing.

### %INVESTING IN "THIRTY HILLS": Building a self-sufficient and sustainable future

ABT was started with the support of NGO founders, early backers, and public sector funding. The last five years have shown tremendous growth and a vision for its future. “In just a few more years, ABT could achieve financial self-sufficiency, a huge success for demonstrating the lucrative healing power of ecosystem restoration and protection,” says Jan Vertefeuille, Senior Advisor for Wildlife Conservation, WWF. Vertefeuille hopes that ABT’s success will serve as a blueprint for future similar concessions and Indonesia’s current 15 other ecosystem restoration concessions.

Indonesia is known as the Emerald of the Equator because of its lush, green rain forests. Though much of these forests have disappeared, Thirty Hills signals hope for what remains.

## %Elephant collaring – protecting the giants of Sabah

For a while, the only detectable movements are those of the herd lumbering slowly and steadily ahead. With a sudden whoosh, a tranquilizer dart is fired at a female elephant in the group. It takes around 20 minutes for the sedative to take effect. Once it does, and the animal can be approached safely, the members of the elephant collaring team emerge from their hiding places in the brush and spring into action.

The team—comprised of veterinarian Cheryl Cheah and her assistants from the Elephant Conservation Unit at WWF-Malaysia, alongside their counterparts from Sabah’s State Forestry Department—moves together with agility and speed. 

Some make loud noises to distract and deter the other elephants in the herd while another team member quickly places the tracking collar around the sedated elephant’s neck, ensuring the strap is comfortable enough for the elephant, while not too loose that it can get it off, and the transmitter on the strap is functional and fitted right-side up. At the same time, someone else draws blood from the animal’s ear, and another takes various physical readings and measurements, such as tail length, that will later help Cheah determine the elephant’s overall health. The entire process is over in a matter of minutes. Afterward, the elephant is given an antidote to reverse the effects of the sedative, and she is off on her way to reunite with the rest of her herd.

Sabah, a Malaysian state in northern Borneo, is home to a population of approximately 1,500 Bornean elephants. The smallest of the Asian elephants, the Bornean elephant is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as an endangered species. In the last 40 years, Sabah has lost 60% of its elephant habitat to plantations, and elephants are now spending a majority of their time in those plantations or are moving through them to get to fragmented forest patches. With more and more forests cut down to make way for palm oil plantations and other agriculture, the elephants’ shrinking habitat brings them closer and closer to people, increasing the instances of human-elephant conflict in the region.

According to Cheah, there have been as many as 30 elephant deaths in Sabah in the past three years, believed to be a result of conflict with humans. By collaring to track the elephants’ movement and gaining an understanding of where they have been and where they are going, members of the WWF Elephant Conservation Unit and their partners are able to develop strategies to reduce potential conflicts.

The elephant collaring program was first established in October of 2013. Since then, Cheah and her team have helped put trackers on more than 25 elephants. Each collar costs roughly $4,000 USD, and the team receives funding to partially cover the expenses from WWF-Netherlands. “The collars give us three to four readings every day, which will allow us to study the elephants’ movements and better understand their range requirements,” explains Cheah.

Knowing where elephants like to roam in the region—if they prefer highlands to lowlands; if herds trek through untouched forests; or if they are migrating through plantations or other areas inhabited by humans—is important information to help protect them, she says.

To complement the data collected from the collars, the team ground truths this information through additional field research. “We follow the target elephants day and night by foot,” says Viccutter Denius, a senior program assistant who works with Cheah. To track the animals, Denius and his partner, Elbatius Sikul, sometimes spend a week or more walking through and sleeping in the forest. They take notes on the elephants’ movements, count herd size, and make other observations useful to the team’s conservation efforts. The work is physically demanding and at times can be dangerous, but Denius says he loves what he does. “Elephants are very social creatures,” he says. “I love learning about their behavior.”

The WWF Elephant Conservation Unit uses the elephant movement data to work with policymakers and plantation owners to find suitable places to establish protective barriers and wildlife corridors. Building blockades to deter herds from land occupied by humans and creating alternative safe pathways for them to move from one area to another helps protect the elephants and the people who live and work near them, creating a future in which humans and nature can live in harmony.
