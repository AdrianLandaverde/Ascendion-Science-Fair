# %GREATER MEKONG

The Greater Mekong region holds irreplaceable riches—ranging from rare wildlife in spectacular natural landscapes to communities with distinct cultural heritages. The vast region spans six countries: China, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Its 200 million acres—the combined size of Texas and Arkansas—contain some of the most biologically diverse habitats in the world.

This is the ‘rice bowl’ of Asia and at its heart lays the Mekong River. Winding almost 3,000 miles from the Tibetan plateau down to the South China Sea, the Mekong River boasts the world's largest inland fishery. It accounts for up to 25 percent of the global freshwater catch and provides livelihoods for tens of millions of people. It is second only to the Amazon River in terms of fish biodiversity. At least 1,200 freshwater species swim the waters of this mighty river including the last remaining populations of the Irrawaddy dolphin, giant freshwater stingray which can weigh up to 1,300 pounds, and the Mekong giant catfish. 

Unprecedented social and economic development in the Greater Mekong makes conservation work here especially urgent and significant. The most pressing threats are hydropower development, climate change, illegal wildlife trade and habitat loss.

CONTINENT: Asia
SPECIES: Indochinese tiger, Saola, Asian elephant, Irrawaddy dolphin

## %SPECIES

The Greater Mekong has no fewer than 20,000 species of plants, 1,200 bird species, 800 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 430 mammal species. Over 1300 new species have been catalogued since 1997. Forest landscapes—spanning an area roughly the size of France—are the largest combined tiger habitat in the world and are priority areas for WWF’s tiger conservation work.

The main species are:

- SAOLA
- IRRAWADDY DOLPHIN
- ASIAN ELEPHANT

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

People have lived in the Greater Mekong region for more than 4,000 years. Today, these lands are home to more than 300 million people from nearly 100 distinct ethnic groups. Around 80 percent of the population depends on healthy natural systems such as rivers, forests and wetlands for food security, livelihoods and culture. Few places on Earth demonstrate so dramatically the fundamental link between human and ecosystem well being. This is why people are central to our conservation strategies.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: KAYAH-KAREN TENASSERIM HIGHLANDS

Six different ethnic groups inhabit Kayah-Karen Tenasserim, the highlands that span the mountainous border between Thailand and Myanmar. The Akha, Hmong, Lu Mien, Karen, Lisu and Lahu each display traditions, beliefs, and dress codes that can be further subdivided based on religion and dialect. Traditionally migratory swidden farmers, they have seen their traditional dynamic farming systems gradually disappear leading to a sedentary agricultural lifestyle.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: DRY FOREST ECOSYSTEMS

In the Dry Forest of Cambodia and Thailand, over 80% of the population is from minority ethnic groups such as the Jarai, Kraol, Phnong, Ro Oung, Stieng, Su, Oey, Kreung, and Tampuan, as well as Cham, Chinese, Khmer, Lao, and Vietnamese. All of these groups have distinct customs, traditions, languages, and beliefs. Each interacts with the environment in various ways, and utilizes a variety of natural resources. The Phnong, for example, are the largest group and are heavily dependent on forest

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: GREATER ANNAMITES MOUNTAINS

The Greater Annamite Mountains, lying east of the Mekong River, provide one of the last intact natural protections from climate change. Home to around 30 million people from 70 ethnic groups, the natural ecosystems within the Annamites provide communities with food and water, natural resources to build from or trade, and an environment in which to practice centuries old customs. For generations, people such as the Ruc and Khamu Rok in the upland areas have used forest resources sustainably and according to traditional custom.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
- ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE
- DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION
- INFRASTRUCTURE

### %THREATS: EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

The Greater Mekong is one of the most vulnerable places on earth to the impacts of climate change, which compounds existing and projected threats. It impacts the region’s people, biodiversity and natural resources with cascading effects. Water scarcity, for example, leads to reduced agricultural productivity, leading to food scarcity, unemployment and poverty. Across the region, temperatures have risen and continue to rise. Sea level rise is threatening the region’s coastal communities. Degradation of ecosystems from climate change will decrease their productivity and capacity to provide livelihoods for people of the Greater Mekong.

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

Illegal wildlife trade results in the loss of precious species and also severely alters the ecosystems in which species and people live. In the Greater Mekong, the region’s biodiversity is threatened to the point where the survival of species like tigers and elephants hangs in the balance. In 2011, the last Javan rhino in Vietnam was declared extinct. Poaching was the likely cause of the death, as it was found with a bullet in its leg and had its horn removed. A false belief that rhino horn cures cancer has skyrocketed demand in Vietnam, where its costs as much as gold.

An estimated 3,700–4,500 tonnes of wildlife products (excluding birds and insects) are traded and consumed every year in Vietnam alone. Within Southeast Asia, Vietnam supplies international markets, particularly China, with a variety of plants and animals. It is also a major illegal wildlife trade conduit.

### %THREATS: DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION

Forest cover in the Greater Mekong has fallen from over 55% in the early 1970s to 34% today. Population growth, poor land-use planning and economic policies have led to deforestation and biodiversity loss across the Greater Mekong region. Loss of forest habitat and biodiversity weakens the region's ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change and puts communities at risk. Recent expansion in the scale and intensity of these agricultural activities has come with significant costs to the environment. In Cambodia and Laos, a surge of land concessions for agricultural plantations has added pressure on both natural ecosystems and the rural communities that depend upon them.

Additionally—because agriculture is often linked to the construction of infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, and dams—it leads to significant secondary impacts on the environment through forest degradation, habitat fragmentation and increased poaching.

### %THREATS: INFRASTRUCTURE

Areas that were once remote are transforming fast in the Greater Mekong region. Populations are booming and the demand for energy and natural resources is reaching new heights. Countries are rolling out economic plans of unprecedented scale that include new hydropower dams, roads and free flows of goods and people across national borders. These developments are necessary to improve the lives of millions of people in the region, but if they are not planned sustainably it could also create serious and irreversible problems—particularly now in the face of climate change. WWF believes more information is necessary to fully measure the economic and environmental implications of mainstream dam construction.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

They are:

- STOPPING WILDLIFE TRADE
- ASSESSING HYDROPOWER IMPACTS
- ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE
- PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
- BUILDING A BALANCED INFRASTRUCTURE
- IMPLEMENTING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES
- THE FINAL FRONTIER

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: STOPPING WILDLIFE TRADE

Wildlife poaching for illegal trade, food consumption and traditional Chinese medicine are dangerously depleting populations of endangered species. Construction of new roads is opening the once-remote areas that house these species to human exploration and poaching. WWF partners with local institutions and national governments to establish wildlife habitat protections—strengthening enforcement and limiting encroachments on protected areas. TRAFFIC, WWF’s wildlife trade monitoring network, is working to protect wildlife and improve transboundary enforcement under the International Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ASSESSING HYDROPOWER IMPACTS

WWF is the only organization working on the Mekong River from source to sea. We support a ten-year delay in the approval of lower Mekong river mainstream dams to ensure a comprehensive understanding of all the impacts of their construction and operation. WWF develops tools to help assess which tributaries can be developed for hydropower without compromising the ecological integrity of the lower Mekong basin. For example, a key project we are working on uses the best available science to map the entire river system so that we can advise decision makers where not to put a dam. A poorly placed dam will have a domino effect, impacting fish migration and spawning as well as sediment deposition, which in turn affects food security in the region.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE

Anticipated impacts from climate change create an urgent need to address infrastructure development in the region and create climate-proof conservation landscapes. WWF carries out climate change vulnerability assessments in priority landscapes—looking at sectors that deal with food security, migration, disaster relief, as well as more traditional environmental areas. We help to build a region-wide climate change resilient network for protected areas and corridors. WWF is one of the few international non-governmental organizations that works directly with local communities to restore wetlands and coastal mangroves, prime aquaculture and agricultural lands. These projects will help build resilience to climate change impacts like sea-level rise, and extreme flooding and drought events.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY

Increased global demand for wood products has spurred an aggressive timber industry that operates largely uncontrolled. WWF collaborates with companies, communities and governments to encourage responsible forestry practices that lead to sustainable certification standards. This approach will enhance local economies, integrate watershed management, conserve biodiversity, and provide a long-term solution on a global scale. At a local level, WWF integrates landscape and land use planning into existing development so that high conservation value forests are protected. We also promote community forestry and community based natural resource management. In Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, villages rely heavily on the rattan trade (roughly 600 species of palms). But rattan has also been depleted from forests at an unnatural rate. In 2009, WWF launched the “Sustainable Rattan Project” to strengthen sustainability along the rattan supply chain in the region.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: BUILDING A BALANCED INFRASTRUCTURE

The construction of economic corridors—essentially large infrastructure and energy blocks—is accelerating transboundary trade and commerce. At the same time, this construction threatens the region’s biodiversity and local livelihoods with long-term consequences that are just becoming apparent. WWF leads a collaborative effort with the Asian Development Bank and other conservation partners to promote sustainable approaches to infrastructure development that protect vital habitat corridors for wildlife and mitigate secondary impacts, such as deforestation and illegal wildlife trade.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: IMPLEMENTING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES

The region’s transition from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture presents one of the most serious threats to biodiversity. Today, agricultural enterprises convert forest habitats into farming land for crops such as sugar, rice and rubber. With demand growing for these thirsty crops, WWF works with local communities and industry to encourage responsible agricultural practices that minimize habitat loss and reduce impacts on water use and quality. In 2007, WWF and The Coca-Cola Company launched a multi-year partnership to conserve and protect freshwater resources. The $20 million commitment from The Coca-Cola Company to WWF helps to conserve seven of the world's most important freshwater river basins, including the Mekong.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: THE FINAL FRONTIER

With three of the most pristine large rivers and some of the most extensive intact forest in the region, Myanmar is one of the most biologically diverse and ecologically productive nations on Earth. Its rich natural assets form the foundation for Myanmar’s long-term sustainable development. In recent decades Myanmar has witnessed its neighbors over-exploit their natural wealth, from deforestation to illegal wildlife trade. Now as the country opens up politically and economically, it’s feeling many of the same pressures faced by the rest of the Greater Mekong region.

In 2014, WWF is formally opening an office in Myanmar to ensure its economic growth continues to sustain the lives of people and wildlife. WWF’s aim is to support the country’s sustainable development ambitions with a focus on spatial planning, biodiversity and ecosystem services protection and sustainable livelihoods.

WWF’s Russell E. Train Education for Nature Program (EFN) is offering the best and brightest future conservation leaders from Myanmar the opportunity to pursue graduate-level study anywhere in the world with the goal of advancing conservation.

## %Preserving the lifeline of Southeast Asia: the urgent call to protect the Mekong River Basin

In the heart of Southeast Asia lies a lifeline crucial for both humans and wildlife: the Mekong River. Often referred to by those in the region as the “mother of all things,” the Mekong River holds immense cultural significance. Traditional communities deeply cherish their connection to the river, engaging in festivals and daily rituals that form an essential part of their cultural heritage. Similarly, the fish of the Mekong hold profound importance, having been integral to the lives, culinary traditions, and cultural identities of the people within the river basin for centuries. However, the story of this majestic river has taken a troubling turn since the commencement of large-scale dam constructions in 1965. While dams are often touted as sources of renewable energy and flood management solutions, their adverse environmental impacts on the Mekong ecosystem cannot be ignored.

The Mekong River Basin is a sanctuary for an extraordinary array of wildlife, particularly its dazzlingly diverse fish species. With a staggering 1,148 fish species officially recognized, the Mekong is a global hotspot for freshwater biodiversity. Among its inhabitants are the world's two largest freshwater fish: the colossal giant catfish, reaching lengths of nearly three yards and weighing a staggering 645 pounds, and the giant freshwater stingray. However, despite their grandeur, these iconic species face an uncertain future. Startling evidence in a WWF report “Mekong’s Forgotten Fishes” reveals that 74 fish species in the Mekong are assessed as at risk of extinction, with 18 species now classified as critically endangered. The Lower Mekong, stretching beneath the China border, has seen about 17% of its rivers impacted primarily due to dam constructions in China, according to a 2022 WWF study. The repercussions of these interventions reverberate far downstream, affecting communities and wildlife alike. One of the most affected groups is the migratory fish essential for the region's ecological balance and the livelihoods of millions of people.

The connectivity of river systems is a fundamental aspect often overlooked, yet crucial to understanding the far-reaching impacts of human interventions. As exemplified by the Mekong River, actions at the upper reaches of a river can cascade down, affecting ecosystems and communities hundreds of miles away. Migratory fish face numerous threats from dam constructions, including obstruction of their movement for spawning and migration, direct harm from turbine operations, and the disruption of natural river flows. These challenges are compounded by other threats such as destructive fishing practices, habitat loss, sand extraction, and the introduction of invasive species. In the case of the Mekong, the well-being of both humans and fish is intricately linked to the river's health. With 68 million people residing in its vicinity, the river sustains livelihoods, providing essential protein sources for millions, and plays a pivotal role in regional economies, serving as the largest inland fishery on the planet.

Around the world, species have recovered when given the chance. Small changes can have big consequences for fish, especially when conservation efforts are led and supported by local communities. And although many of the species in the Mekong are facing extinction, their final disappearance is not written in stone.

### %Preserving the lifeline of Southeast Asia: the urgent call to protect the Mekong River Basin: How people and fish exist in the Mekong

Amidst growing concerns about the conservation of freshwater resources, the Mekong Forgotten Fishes Report sheds light on innovative approaches to preserve and invest in the health of this vital waterway.

Recreational angling presents a promising avenue for economic development and conservation, although its current scale is limited. The region's diverse giant and novel freshwater fish offer significant potential to attract anglers worldwide. While stocked lakes feature native species like the Siamese giant barb and giant snakehead, non-native species pose a threat if they escape. Recreational angling on the river itself, though limited, is gaining traction, particularly in Cambodia and Lao PDR, where operators offer trips targeting Mekong giant catfish and giant freshwater stingrays. However, concerns arise regarding governance and monitoring, especially in conservation areas like Nakai-Nam Theun National Park. In the Mekong Delta, recreational angling is more established, with tourists being offered experiences like catching fish bare-handed. While recreational angling holds potential for livelihoods and tourism, careful management is crucial to mitigate risks such as invasive species introduction and habitat damage. With effective management and community collaboration, promoting recreational angling in the Mekong Basin could contribute to species conservation and community well-being.

Rice-fish farming is an innovative farming practice that integrates fish into rice paddies, harnessing the natural synergy between the two ecosystems. As rice grows, it provides cover and food for fish, while the fish, in turn, help control pests and provide natural fertilization, enhancing rice yields. Additionally, fish disturb the soil, making it more porous and assisting with nutrient recycling. Some farmers have devised methods to increase water depth in their fields during the natural flood season, preventing fish from escaping and creating a thriving aquatic habitat. Recognizing the potential of rice-fish farming to promote sustainability, WWF is actively collaborating with farmers to implement floating rice and fish farming during the flood season. This initiative aims to restore natural sediment deposition, improve soil fertility and health, and counteract land subsidence. Moreover, it creates new markets and enhances the resilience and income of farmers, demonstrating the transformative power of sustainable farming practices in the Mekong region. By safeguarding fish populations and maintaining healthy freshwater ecosystems, we can ensure the continued availability of essential resources such as food, water, and livelihoods for millions of people in the region.

### %Preserving the lifeline of Southeast Asia: the urgent call to protect the Mekong River Basin: A brighter future for the Mekong

Protecting the Mekong River basin is not just about preserving biodiversity; it is also about securing the well-being of communities that depend on the river for their livelihoods.

Fortunately, recent global initiatives, such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, offer hope for the conservation and restoration of inland waters, including the Mekong. By joining efforts like the Freshwater Challenge, countries can work together to protect and restore critical habitats, implement sustainable management practices, and prevent the spread of invasive species. Additionally, an Emergency Recovery Plan for Freshwater Biodiversity, already in existence, provides a roadmap for comprehensive action to safeguard the freshwater ecosystem:

1. Let rivers flow more naturally

2. Improve water quality in freshwater ecosystems

3. Protect and restore critical habitats and species

4. End unsustainable management of resources

5. Prevent and control invasions by nonnative species

6. Protect free-flowing rivers and remove absolute river barriers

The people of the Mekong cannot afford to lose their freshwater fish or the freshwater ecosystems they inhabit. Rivers, lakes, and wetlands are their life support systems and the extraordinary diversity of fish within them is essential to their health. Reversing decades of decline will be difficult, but it is possible—if we act collectively and urgently.

## %Protecting, restoring, and coexisting with Asia’s magnificent elephants

A century ago, around 100,000 elephants roamed across the vast lands of Asia.

But today, this is no longer the case. According to estimates from the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are likely less than 50,000 individuals estimated in the wild, inhabiting a mere 5% of their original range in 13 countries. Huge swathes of forest have been destroyed to make way for human settlements, replaced by rapidly expanding infrastructure and endless fields of crops in just decades. With their habitats shrinking, elephants encounter people more frequently, leading to conflicts that often impact both wildlife and communities. The climate crisis also exacerbates impacts on elephants.

These threats, coupled with illegal wildlife trade driven by demand for ivory and traditional medicinal products, and small, isolated Asian elephant populations have led to the decline of the species’ population to a fraction of their historical numbers.

But amidst this adversity, a network of people has come together to find solutions to understand, restore, protect, and sustainably coexist with these magnificent animals.

Whether starting from a place of profound love for these magnificent animals, or one born of a need to defend homes and damaged livelihoods, many people play unique and necessary roles in building a future in which elephants can thrive in healthy habitats alongside communities.

## %380 new species discovered in the Greater Mekong in 2021 and 2022

A color-changing lizard, a thick-thumbed bat, a venomous snake named after a Chinese mythological goddess, an orchid that looks like a Muppet, and a tree frog with skin that resembles thick moss are just five of the 380 new species described by scientists in the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia in 2021 and 2022, according to a new WWF report.

The report documents the work of hundreds of scientists from universities, conservation organizations, and research institutes around the world who discovered 290 plants, 19 fishes, 24 amphibians, 46 reptiles, and one mammal in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. This brings the total number of vascular plants, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals described in the Greater Mekong region since 1997 to 3,389.

“While the Mekong region is a global biodiversity hotspot, it is also experiencing a vast array of threats,” said Nilanga Jayasinghe, manager, Asian species, WWF. “It is critical that we continue to invest in the protection and conservation of nature, so these magnificent species don’t disappear before we know of their existence."

With many of the species already under threat of extinction from human activities, WWF is calling on governments in the region to increase protection for these rare, amazing creatures, and their habitats.

WWF works with government, non-profits, communities, and other partners across the five Greater Mekong countries on conservation strategies designed to protect these species and their habitat. We protect flagship species such as Asian elephants, Irrawaddy dolphins, and tigers, as well as the forests, rivers, and oceans they depend on. To stop wildlife declines, WWF is strengthening networks of protected and conserved areas and tackling the snaring crisis, illegal wildlife markets, online wildlife trade, and the financial crimes associated with wildlife trafficking.

## %Scientists discover 224 new species in the Greater Mekong

A new WWF report reveals 224 plant and vertebrate animal species were discovered in the Greater Mekong region (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam) in 2020. These species include 155 plants, 16 fish, 17 amphibians, 35 reptiles, and one mammal, bringing the total number of new species described in this region to 3,007 since 1997.

Among the new discoveries is a primate, the Popa langur, named after an extinct volcano in Myanmar, a “stink bug” flower that is also used in a chili dipping sauce by the Isan people of northern Thailand, and the first succulent bamboo species, meaning its stems can inflate and deflate during the dry and wet seasons, enabling it to survive different drought conditions.

These discoveries are thanks to the work of hundreds of scientists, NGOs, and other research and academic institutions around the world. They also demonstrate that the region is still a frontline for scientific exploration and a hotspot of species diversity. Unfortunately, many species go extinct before they are even discovered, driven by habitat destruction, diseases spread by human activities, predation by and competition with invasive species, and the illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade. WWF is calling on governments in the region to increase protection for these rare species and their shrinking habitats before they disappear.

Check out five of our favorite species from the report:

1. An orange-brown knobby newt from Thailand—Tylototriton phukhaensis—has devil horns and a racing stripe. It was originally observed by chance in a 20-year-old photograph from a travel magazine, sparking researchers’ interest in discovering if it still exists.
2.  A langur,Trachypithecus popa, is a monkey named after Myanmar’s revered Mount Popa and was first identified in the form of 100-year-old museum specimens from the UK’s Natural History Museum. With an estimated 200 - 250 in the wild, it is threatened by hunting and habitat loss, driven by agricultural encroachment and timber extraction.
3. Amomum foetidum, a plant from the ginger family, was discovered in a plant shop in eastern Thailand and emits a pungent odor. It’s often used as a substitute for stink bugs in a popular chili paste.
4. Leptobrachium lunatum is a big-headed frog from Viet Nam and Cambodia that’s threatened by ongoing deforestation and harvesting of its tadpoles for food.
5. Thailand’s San Phueng rock gecko—Cnemaspis selenolagus—looks like it has a half-finished paint job. It has yellow-orange on its upper body that abruptly turns grey halfway down its back, allowing it to camouflage itself against the lichen and dry moss on rocks and trees.
