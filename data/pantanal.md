# %PANTANAL

Situated in the heart of South America, the Pantanal is the world’s largest tropical wetland. At 42 million acres, the Pantanal covers an area slightly larger than nine U.S. states and sprawls across three countries—Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. While not as globally familiar as the Amazon to the north, the Pantanal is one of the most biologically rich environments on the planet with more than 4,700 plant and animal species. In fact, the Pantanal contains South America’s highest concentration of some iconic wildlife species, including the jaguar and caiman.

From October to March, floodwaters fill the Pantanal like a giant reservoir and drain out slowly between April and September, providing ideal aquatic habitat, nutrient renewal, and flood control for millions of people downstream. This flood pulse provides an array of irreplaceable benefits that help the region's economic development and environment, including river flow for boats to navigate, groundwater recharge, and regulation of floodwaters for millions of people. The Pantanal’s economic activity ranges from cattle ranching to soy production to tourism, boosting the local economies of each state within it by billions.

## %SPECIES

The main species are:

- MACAW
- JAGUAR

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

The Pantanal is a dynamic and growing place, for both the people and nature who thrive there. In a single year the Pantanal fluctuates between drought and deluge, providing livelihoods to over 270 communities. A wide range of people, from small indigenous groups in Paraguay to cattle ranchers in Bolivia and soy farmers in Brazil, call the region home. More than 1.5 million people need the Pantanal for income, food security, and drinking water, while millions more downstream depend on the expansive wetland for flood control.

## %THREATS

The Pantanal’s complex and interconnected nature is what makes it so rich with biodiversity and natural resources, but it’s also what makes it so challenging to conserve and develop sustainably. More than 1,200 rivers and streams converge to form the Pantanal, including the free-flowing Paraguay River. These rivers are the arteries of the Pantanal but carry with them upstream pollutants from agriculture and other industries. Unsustainable infrastructure is also a threat here, with over 100 hydroelectric dams currently planned in the headwaters of the Pantanal. If completed, these dams will reduce river connectivity and interfere with the natural seasonal cycle. These threats impact the whole ecosystem, so require holistic solutions that tackle the challenges in their entirety.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

On the current trajectory, the pace of degradation of this unique ecosystem will increase and we will lose the Pantanal as we know it. But there is still an opportunity to save it.

Development must be strategically and sustainably planned in a coordinated effort across all three countries and seven ecoregions. For over 20 years, WWF has collaborated farmers and ranchers, the private sector, local and national governments and communities to balance conservation priorities with the region’s economic development. In March 2018, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia signed a declaration agreeing to coordinate actions to reduce pollution, strengthen water governance, mitigate climate change, and expand scientific knowledge, while protecting the rights of indigenous peoples. Through a holistic approach and developing solutions to tackle the growing threats, this magnificent wetland of international importance can continue to support people and nature for generations to come.

## %With access to fresh water, a school garden grows

BRAZIL - Neat rows of lettuce, arugula, parsley and chives dot the garden outside Nossa Senhora Aparecida Elementary School. Vines of plump tomatoes and cucumbers crawl along the rich soil, while carrots, manioc, and squash grow beneath it.

It’s the 285 students of the school who tend the food being grown here — watering it daily, spreading organic fertilizer and harvesting the vegetables when ready — a task they relish because it means they’ve played a hand in making their own lunch.

“A lot of the kids had never had greens before we got the garden going,” said Marcelo Marques Raimundo, one of the teachers who oversees the garden’s care at the school, which straddles the Pantanal and Cerrado. “But now they get to eat them every day.”

The small settlement community of Sapiquá, part of the city of Cáceres in the state of Mato Grosso, had never been ideal for growing much. It long suffered without fresh water, its land so dry with drought that even drilling for wells turned up nothing. An area of the Cerrado savanna, this region is part of the headwaters of the Pantanal and the birthplace to the many rivers that fill up the world’s largest tropical wetland. Combatting drought in this region is not only important to this community, but the overall health of the Pantanal, and it is a priority for WWF’s work in the region.

Residents tried bringing in water from a reservoir more than seven miles away, but it was contaminated by the capybaras that drank from it, and the truck that carried the water to them sloughed rust into it.

And when the truck broke down, they’d have nothing for 15 or 20 days. They couldn’t clean the elementary school or flush toilets, let alone open the local high school, which was built in 2009 and sat empty for years.

Without enough classrooms, the older students had to be taught outside, seeking shelter from the sweltering sun under small groupings of mango trees.

But in 2009 principal and teacher Marcia Novakc da Silva decided to join forces with others in her community to make a change. They started to collect rainwater, running pipes along the school’s roof that funneled runoff to be stored in a cistern that holds 100,000 liters. The community rainwater project was led by the organization Incra and supported by WWF through the Pantanal Pact in Defense of the Headwaters of the Pantanal — which implements several projects for the recovery of the springs and water supply in region.

Since then, the school has never gone without fresh water. While drinking water still has to be piped in from a well in another community nearly seven miles away, the rainwater collected in the tank allows the staff to keep the school clean and the students to care for the garden, providing them with healthy meals and vegetables that otherwise would have been out of reach.

The high school set up a similar system and was able to open its doors in 2014. Its 350 students also look after their own garden.

Silva hopes their work can serve as an example for the rest of the community and that rainwater can be collected for homes too.

School principals also participate in the NGOs and municipalities to create environmental education resources for the schools in region, ensuring the future resilience of the communities and the Pantanal.

“This has changed everything for us 100%,” she said. “And there’s still so much more for us to do. Without water we’re nothing.”

## %Finding a wildlife paradise in Brazil’s expansive Pantanal

THE PANTANAL :: BRAZIL

Most people visit the Pantanal, the world’s largest tropical wetland, excited to see big cats—especially the elusive jaguar. I would have been thrilled to see just one. But while traveling with Natural Habitat Adventures, I was lucky to see several, each sighting an exhilarating experience in one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been. But more than the cats, it’s the variety and abundance of the Pantanal’s wildlife that still fill my imagination. With an average camera and below-average photography skills, I am still amazed at what I was able to capture.

Capybaras, the biggest rodents on Earth, are plentiful in the Pantanal, and Brazilians seemed amused by our fascination with them. But their gentle playfulness—the adults just as unassuming and adorable as the pups—made them a favorite. Where there’s water, caimans too are ubiquitous. Well-camouflaged and usually sedentary during the day, many more lurk in the brush and shallow waters than are seen at first glance. Only in the dark, with their eyes reflecting light, can one appreciate their numbers, their twinkling eyes resembling the stars in the southern night sky above.

Birds captured our attention as well. Of the maybe hundreds of bird species we encountered, I committed only a dozen names to memory, but I’ll never forget the hyacinth macaws. The world’s largest flying parrot and a brilliant cobalt blue, the birds were almost always soaring together in seemingly identical pairs.

Yet it is the people of the Pantanal, from lodge owners to cattle ranchers, I most remember—because of their extraordinary devotion to and enthusiasm about protecting and sharing these unique natural treasures.

## %ROAD TO RECOVERY IN LATIN AMERICA

Ricardo Schwartz was excited as he awaited the big delivery. A 10-month-old Maremma sheepdog had just made the two-day, nearly 2,000-mile journey from Patagonia to Misiones Province in the northeastern tip of Argentina, transported in a blue kennel atop a truck bed by two technicians from the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria (INTA). Once it arrived, the specially trained dog would have an important job to do: help a local farmer protect his sheep from a jaguar.

Together, Schwartz and the farmer had tried other methods to scare away the predator—electric fences, automatic floodlights, loud noises—but nothing had worked. Schwartz feared that if they couldn’t find a solution, the farmer would eventually kill the jaguar.

But INTA had a solution. For years, the institute has been breeding sheepdogs and training them to guard livestock against predators to help minimize conflicts between herders and pumas in Patagonia, explains Schwartz. As puppies, the dogs are raised alongside a flock of sheep and spend 24 hours a day with them, which fosters a strong bond between the animals. In time, “the dog is adopted by the sheep ... and defends them as if they were family,” constantly patrolling and marking its territory. “It’s basically a sheep that barks,” he says.

Schwartz understands well the challenges farmers in Misiones face. He moved to the region with his family when he was 14 years old and has been working the same land—growing yerba mate and raising chickens, pigs, and cattle—for most of his life. Some two decades ago, he too began losing his livestock to a jaguar. Then conservationists from the Fundación Vida Silvestre Argentina (or Vida Silvestre), a WWF partner organization since 1988, approached Schwartz at a cattle fair and offered to install an electric fence around his pasture.

The fence was a game changer. In addition to successfully safeguarding his livestock, it transformed Schwartz into an unlikely evangelist for jaguar conservation; he’s been helping fellow farmers find nonlethal alternatives to human-jaguar conflict ever since. And sheepdogs, he believes, are a promising tool. If they work in Misiones as well as they have in Patagonia, he says, they could allow farmers and jaguars to share the land more peacefully.

Managing conflict between wildlife and farmers is just one way that conservationists are working to protect and increase jaguar populations in Misiones and across the Americas, where deforestation, infrastructure development, and poaching also pose increasing threats. As those pressures on jaguars and their habitats intensify, Vida Silvestre, WWF, and a growing number of organizations, governments, and civil society groups are now banding together in an unprecedented international effort to change the trajectory for this iconic big cat.

### %ROAD TO RECOVERY IN LATIN AMERICA: King of the forest

The jaguar, Panthera onca, is the largest feline in the Americas and has been an important mythological and cultural symbol among Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In pre-Columbian artwork, jaguars are depicted on tools, statues, and temples. The Maya associated the cat with the afterlife, believing it could move between the worlds of the living and the dead. And the Olmecs worshiped a half-jaguar/half-human deity, revering the creature for its strength and dominance over the natural world.

Historically, the jaguar roamed freely from Argentina to the southern US—across tropical forests, savannas, wetlands, and mountain ranges. But core populations now exist mainly in a few strongholds, including the Amazon region and the Pantanal wetland, linked by a vast mosaic of biological corridors that are vital to their survival.

Because it sits at the top of the food chain and travels so widely, the jaguar is an “umbrella species”: Conservation of the jaguar positively affects the whole ecosystem and the other species in it. “If we have healthy jaguar populations, then it’s likely that all biodiversity is healthy, because the prey and the forest have to be healthy for jaguars to survive,” says Jordi Surkin, director of conservation at WWF-Bolivia.

In a way, jaguars are an umbrella species for humans as well. Today, the jaguar’s range not only includes nearly 28% of the world’s biodiversity but provides 53 million people with ecosystem services, including freshwater, commercial fisheries, clean air, and crop pollination. In Brazil alone, it’s estimated that these environmental services generate more than US$4 billion annually.

But despite its cultural and ecological significance, the species is at risk. More than half of the jaguar’s original range has been lost, while the rest has become highly fragmented. In the last 20 years, rising global appetites for soy and beef—two of the biggest drivers of agricultural expansion in South America—have fueled a rapid, substantial clearing of the continent’s forests that has pushed jaguars into ever-smaller, isolated patches of land.

The Atlantic Forest, which encompasses Misiones and stretches from Brazil’s Atlantic coastline into Paraguay and Argentina, has been particularly hard hit. Centuries ago, the jaguar padded through the entire expanse—more than 500,000 square miles—of this vast region. But about 85% of jaguar habitat here has disappeared, and by 2016 fewer than 300 individuals occupied less than 4% of the forest; just three isolated pockets had jaguar populations larger than 50.

In Brazil and Bolivia, large-scale wildfires over the past two years have also decimated jaguar habitats and prey populations, and an increasing demand for jaguar parts—furs and fangs especially—has driven a recent surge in poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. At the same time, hunting has diminished the jaguar’s prey in some places, and as the cats turn to livestock for easy meals, they’re often killed in retaliation.

“When jaguar habitat is fragmented and people move into that habitat, then jaguars may get used to going after cattle—and also may lack other options. That’s when we start to see human-wildlife conflicts,” explains Surkin.

While it’s estimated that between 64,000 and 173,000 jaguars still exist in the wild, the numbers of jaguars and their prey are declining in most regions. Studies suggest that the species could soon qualify as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. The feline has already been wiped out in Uruguay and El Salvador. And though momentum is building around a potential reintroduction of jaguars into the southern US, where large blocks of suitable habitat are available, fewer than 10 jaguars have been spotted there since 1963.

### %ROAD TO RECOVERY IN LATIN AMERICA: Connection and cooperation

For years, WWF and organizations such as Vida Silvestre have been working at the local level to conserve jaguars and their habitats. But most of these efforts were isolated projects—monitoring local populations or forest conservation initiatives in specific regions, for instance—and lacked the range-wide cooperation required to prevent vast tracts of territory from disappearing.

“We were losing the battle,” says conservation director María José Villanueva, who heads up WWF’s jaguar conservation work. “We realized we had to collaborate and raise our voices in a more coordinated way." 

So in 2018, WWF, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the United Nations Development Programme, wild cat conservation organization Panthera, and representatives from 14 jaguar range countries joined forces to develop the Jaguar 2030 Roadmap, an ambitious global commitment to protect the jaguar’s range from Mexico to Argentina by securing 30 priority jaguar conservation landscapes by 2030.

Based on a shared vision, the Roadmap is about building collaborative relationships between diverse partners and across the entire span of the jaguar’s natural and potential habitat. It also goes beyond protecting the species in individual conservation sites, says Howard Quigley, executive director of conservation science and director of Panthera’s jaguar program. “The Roadmap deals with all aspects of jaguar conservation, from education to conflict issues to protecting core areas—and even the economic viability of local communities,” he says.

In November 2020, WWF launched its own Jaguar Regional Strategy, which aims to scale up the organization’s jaguar conservation efforts in alignment with the larger Roadmap. The strategy’s goal is to increase and stabilize jaguar populations and restore their habitat by securing jaguar strongholds, building and increasing connectivity between key landscapes, stopping jaguar killings, promoting national and international cooperation across the jaguar’s range, and advocating for public policies that recognize jaguar conservation.

Focusing on one species across several countries and landscapes also allows WWF to be more targeted in its approach.

“Let’s say we want to restore a part of a forest. We’re not going to do that just anywhere,” Surkin explains. “Instead, we’d choose a patch of forest that would help us connect two protected areas or two properties, thereby creating a valuable wildlife corridor for jaguars and other species.”

As part of its strategy, WWF has chosen 15 priority landscapes across the Americas—regions identified as ecologically important for the species—where it will strive to conserve jaguar populations and habitats through tailored, site-specific plans. In the Atlantic Forest, WWF is endeavoring to reconnect fragmented landscapes and work toward more harmonious human-jaguar coexistence. WWF is also working closely with local communities in cross-border partnerships in other jaguar pockets, like the Maya Forest and the Amazon rain forest, to ensure the jaguar’s long-term survival.

### %ROAD TO RECOVERY IN LATIN AMERICA: Progress in Argentina

In the Upper Paraná region of the Atlantic Forest, a priority landscape located mainly in Misiones, WWF’s work with Vida Silvestre provides an example of the complexities inherent in jaguar conservation and how the new strategy plays out on the ground.

Deforestation in Misiones was once rampant. Between 1989 and 2004, the province lost 46,208 acres of forest cover per year, largely to agricultural conversion—more than double the average deforestation rates in the rest of Latin America and five times the global average. The region became a “mosaic of human activity,” says Daniela Rode, a landscape specialist with Vida Silvestre. As habitats shrank and prey disappeared, the jaguar population dropped to just 33–54 cats. “It was on the verge of collapse,” says Rode.

Then in 2003, Vida Silvestre and WWF began working together to try to stanch the jaguar’s decline. Seven years later, new government regulations were enacted to put an end to unchecked forest clearance; by 2013, deforestation rates had dropped by 70%.

But the damage had been done. After such extensive forest loss, recovering native habitats became a key component of Vida Silvestre’s work. Partnering with Argentina’s National Scientific and Technological Research Council, the organization started conducting research to identify jaguar hot spots and to determine how best to relink patches of forest by restoring deforested swaths of land. About a third of the province is made up of larger extensions of forest where jaguars can still be found, and the family farms, perennial crops, and large-scale tree farms that cover the other two-thirds represent conservation hurdles—but not barriers.

Researchers identified five critical jaguar corridors. In 2015, Vida Silvestre and partners successfully completed the first, which ultimately linked two provincial parks by connecting property buyers who wanted to invest in conservation with farmers living between the two parks who were willing to sell their properties. Now a second corridor is in the works.

That kind of cooperation between organizations, governments, and local people is vital for protecting the jaguar across its range, says Rode. And since the Jaguar 2030 Roadmap launched in 2018, Vida Silvestre has begun working more closely with other organizations to share data and resources.

Today the region’s jaguar population stands at 89–125 individuals, and Vida Silvestre is doubling down on its efforts, with more ambitious jaguar corridors, community integration initiatives, and cross-border partnerships underway with WWF offices in Brazil and Paraguay.

“If jaguars are crossing rivers, they’re crossing borders,” adds Rode. “It’s the same population, so cross-border partnerships make sense.”

### %ROAD TO RECOVERY IN LATIN AMERICA: The long game

Eventually, says Rode, “there will be around 121,800 acres connecting three core jaguar habitats: Cruce Caballero Provincial Park, El Piñalito Provincial Park, and the Yabotí Biosphere Reserve.” Jaguars will have more room to breed and seek prey, which will bolster populations and help ensure their genetic diversity.

At the broader scale, Rode notes, WWF’s jaguar strategy will also lead to more funding and cooperation in the region, which will propel important projects such as these corridors forward. “Now we can do many more things in more places with more people, and get closer to what we have planned,” she says.

Surkin, Villanueva, and others agree that jaguar conservation and large landscape protections won’t happen overnight, and will require continued coordination across countries and collaboration among a variety of actors.

But it will have been worth it.

“When you save the jaguar, you save much more,” says Villanueva. “You save the water you drink, you save the air you breathe, and you save a stable climate.”

Back in Misiones, Schwartz says the provincial government is now considering creating local breeding centers after witnessing Maremma sheepdogs in action. He also says that he is invested in jaguar conservation work for the long haul.

“I’ve seen people who care about saving these animals while helping farmers continue with their production. That seems good to me,” he says. “I think I’ll keep doing this.”

## %Finding a delicate balance in the Pantanal

The sprawling Pantanal—its name derived from the Portuguese word pântano, meaning wetland or marsh—supports a wealth of wildlife, plants, and people. As pressures intensify in this vibrant, biodiverse ecosystem, multinational cooperation and a holistic strategy are key to paving a better way forward.

### %Finding a delicate balance in the Pantanal: THREATS

POLLUTION
Millions of people live near and rely on the headwaters of the Upper Paraguay River. But as the river flows southward toward the Pantanal, it carries along pollutants from activities upstream, including mining runoff and agricultural and industrial waste that can spread disease and affect aquatic and terrestrial life. Transnational collaboration and improved waste management policies could curtail pollution, protecting the ecosystem’s health and downstream communities that depend on freshwater and fishing for food and livelihoods.

LAND CONVERSION
Significant grasslands conversion and deforestation have occurred in the Cerrado, Chaco, and Chiquitano ecoregions surrounding the Pantanal, and the Upper Paraguay River Basin has lost 55% of its forest cover to agricultural expansion. As native trees are cleared to meet demand for soy, beef, and biofuel, the threats of forest fires, water scarcity, and flooding are increasing. Without better conservation strategies, deforestation could cause even more extensive habitat loss while also disrupting the ecosystem’s important hydrological rhythms.

INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
Well-connected, intact rivers are crucial for people and nature: They provide habitat for wildlife, safeguard healthy communities, support agriculture and aquaculture, and transport vital nutrients. In the Pantanal, new infrastructure projects—including hydropower dams and a multinational plan to convert stretches of the Paraguay and Paraná rivers into industrial shipping channels—are poised to seriously impact the wetland, reducing river connectivity and interfering with the watershed’s seasonal cycle.

CLIMATE CHANGE
As the planet warms, the Pantanal will become drier and hotter, with average temperatures likely increasing several degrees by the end of the century. Climbing temperatures could have disastrous consequences, from more extreme droughts and floods to altered habitats, more forest fires, and dwindling wetlands. Limiting the conversion of native habitat for agriculture and reducing global carbon emissions are vital for regulating the region’s water cycle and climate in the years to come.

### %Finding a delicate balance in the Pantanal: SOLUTIONS

SUPPORTING SCIENCE
To counter unsustainable development, WWF helps governments and civil society make informed decisions about land use and infrastructure planning through studies such as river basin environmental health reports. We also support various watershed restoration projects.

IMPROVING AGRICULTURE
WWF partners with soy farmers and cattle ranchers to reduce the impacts of their production and eliminate the need for deforestation and land conversion by increasing the efficiency and productivity of land already in use. This increases profitability while protecting native vegetation.

LEVERAGING MARKETS
Companies that buy soy and beef, from traders to supermarket chains, can drive better production practices. Through roundtables, we advise companies on removing deforestation from their supply chains and develop criteria to help them minimize their impact on the environment.

CREATING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
Alongside investors and financial institutions, WWF uses financing tools that encourage producers, traders, and companies to divest from products and practices that contribute to deforestation and habitat loss in key regions like the Chaco and Cerrado.

## %A new water treatment plant transforms life for a community in the Pantanal

MARGARITA ISLAND, Paraguay — Before the water treatment facility was built on Margarita Island, the 350 residents of the tiny Paraguayan community drank straight from the Paraguay River.

Pollutants, dumped by fishermen, tourists and cargo ships, as well as farms and factories located along the river, made kids sick, and stained their clothes with mud. The Paraguay River—a twisting and turning marker of the border that runs between Paraguay and Brazil—is the main waterway of the Pantanal. It’s a source of life and livelihood for many. But for the residents of Margarita Island living downriver meant they not only ingested what was discarded by those in their own community, but also by those upstream and on higher ground in Brazil and Bolivia.

Some families purchased chemicals to treat the river water in their own homes so that they could drink it, but the process was time-consuming and the chemicals too expensive for most to purchase on a regular basis.

In 2015, the nonprofit Pro Comunidades Indígenas (PCI) offered to help the people of Margarita Island to create their own water treatment facility. Though they already had a water committee, the residents jumped at the chance to address the problem at a larger scale. With help from PCI, and funds provided by WWF, the community would now have the resources and trainings to make a significant difference.

“Getting clean water to my community has always been my main goal,” says Margarita Gayoso, head of the island’s water committee. “We can live without a lot of things, but not without water.”

Accessing the materials to build the water tank and pipe system to the island wasn’t easy. Flooding had washed out the one road that came closest to the community, and the only option was to bring them through Brazil before crossing the river by boat.

Today the facility is up and running. Strategically built on high ground to protect against flooding, the plant treats the water and then distributes it to the single tap in each of the community’s homes. With a capacity of 60,000 liters per day, the tank holds four times what the community needs, providing enough clean water for drinking and basic sanitation. Now with regular access to water, community members have strengthened skills related to sustainable water practices and public participation in governance.

The Pantanal’s complex and interconnected nature is what makes it so rich with biodiversity and natural resources, but it’s also what makes it so challenging to conserve and develop sustainably. More than 1,200 rivers and streams converge to form the Pantanal, including the free-flowing Paraguay River so the impacts that occur in one area have a cascading impact across the entire region.

WWF partners with farmers and ranchers, the private sector, communities and local and national governments in Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay to ensure development is sustainably planned and the ecosystem services that fuel economic growth and natural vitality are protected.

Margarita Island is a strong example of how human-made impacts upstream affect communities and livelihoods downstream. People and wildlife across the entire landscape benefit when economic needs are met with sustainable solutions at the local level.

“This [water treatment facility] has given the families here a quality of life they didn’t have before,” says Gayoso. “It’s something that will help our community grow. People will choose to stay here now. Clean water is everything.”

## %SAVING THE PANTANAL

By the time Elizete Garciada Costa Soares wades into the deep, warm waters of the Paraguay River, the sky is usually black.

The tiny crabs and bait fish called tuvira, which she captures with a metal screen, come out at night, long after the hot sun that washes over the Brazilian Pantanal has set.

It takes Soares at least an hour to reach the best spots to fish for bait, where the tuvira and crabs hide under the thick green leaves of the water hyacinths that float on the river’s surface. She’ll be gone for at least three or four days, so she brings a tent to pitch along the riverbank. Later, she will sell the bait to other fishers, usually in the nearby town of Miranda.

Soares is well aware of the dangers of her profession—she’s had her fair share of run-ins with jaguars and anacondas in the 26 years she’s been heading out on the river to fish. But she wouldn’t have it any other way.

“Life here for us is very fulfilling,” says Soares of herself and her husband. “We have fish to eat; we have bait to sell to make money for other necessities. Even if we don’t have money for meat, we can go out on the river to fish and bring back a piranha to eat with manioc flour. Here, we never go hungry.”

### %SAVING THE PANTANAL: A wealth of biodiversity

At just over 42 million acres, the Pantanal is the world’s largest tropical wetland, created by the convergence of more than 1,200 rivers and streams rushing down from the eastern Andes and the high plateaus of the Cerrado, the vast tropical savanna to the east. More than 10 times the size of Florida’s Everglades, it stretches across the borders of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Its primary waterway is the Paraguay River, which meanders through the three countries before joining the Paraná River and flowing into Argentina.

The Pantanal is a landscape of extremes. Acting like a giant sponge, the upper part of the basin retains floodwaters from October to March, providing natural flood protection for the millions of people who live downstream. It then slowly drains between April and September, leaving discrete pools teeming with wildlife and providing life-giving water long after the rains have gone.

This seasonal rise and fall, the pulsing of water in and out of the surrounding landscapes, is responsible for the wetland’s significant biodiversity. Though often overshadowed by the Amazon, its neighbor to the north, the Pantanal is home to more than 4,700 plant and animal species, including fig and ipê trees, jabiru storks, capybaras, and caiman.

The Pantanal offers “a refuge for a wealth of biodiversity not found in other places,” says Michele Thieme, lead scientist and deputy director of freshwater initiatives for WWF-US.

In addition to being an environmental jewel, the Pantanal is also a tremendous resource for people, says Lucy Aquino, director of WWF-Paraguay: “The Pantanal is one of the most important regions in the world, in terms of services provided to humanity, and one of those regions that supplies food to the world.”

### %SAVING THE PANTANAL: Community needs

For now, the Pantanal is relatively intact, sustaining more than 270 communities—1.5 million people—in addition to its flora and fauna, and helping to stabilize the climate throughout the region and beyond.

But while much of the Bolivian Pantanal is protected, the overwhelming majority of the wetland, lying in Paraguay and Brazil, is not. In all, conservation areas represent just 4.6% of the Pantanal, and its headwaters in the Cerrado are at particularly high risk.

In recent years, roads, water management systems, hydroelectric dams, large-scale mines, farms, and cattle ranches have begun to change the dynamics of the wetland, threatening the region’s integrity. In addition to poorly planned infrastructure, mining, and agricultural development, the region faces other threats, including the lack of basic sanitation and the construction of canals for navigation.

Moreover, by the end of the century the Pantanal is expected to be much drier and hotter, with potentially devastating results, including extreme droughts and floods, and the possible shrinking of the wetland as a whole. In the absence of a holistic vision, unsustainable development threatens to limit the Pantanal’s ability to function and to adapt to climate change, putting homes and habitats at risk.

There is a tension between communities’ needs for development—for sanitation services and clean drinking water, for example, along with roads and hydropower dams—and the costs of such development to the ecosystem and people alike. But development done right, well-designed and sustainable, would contribute to the wetland’s conservation, says Julio Cesar Sampaio da Silva, who leads WWF-Brazil’s work in the Cerrado and Pantanal. And while the region reaches into three countries, he says, it must be treated as one.

“Considering the Pantanal as a shared territory and developing strategies for shared management—creating a truly shared vision for the region—is fundamental to having effective conservation of these natural resources,” he says. To that end, WWF has long acted as a facilitator in the region, connecting decision-makers from the three countries through its offices in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay.

### %SAVING THE PANTANAL: All for one

In 2018, the three countries formally signaled their shared commitment to sustaining those resources when they signed a landmark trilateral agreement known as the Pantanal Declaration. WWF offices in all three countries, in the US, and across the WWF network had pushed for and helped guide this agreement. In it, the countries commit to work together to reduce pollution, strengthen water governance, and expand scientific knowledge, while ensuring the rights of Indigenous peoples. That sort of deep, invested collaboration is central to successful conservation work at scale.

“The Pantanal, like any natural area, knows no geopolitical bounds,” says Maurício Voivodic, executive director of WWF-Brazil. “In a scenario where 55% of the Pantanal’s headwaters have already been deforested, an initiative that calls for the integrated and transboundary management of water resources is fundamental for a peaceful and water-secure future.”

Citing the importance of the wetland to those well beyond its boundaries, WWF-Bolivia director Samuel Sangueza-Pardo calls the agreement “a decisive step in integrating Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay’s joint commitment to maintain this ecosystem, which is fundamental for the welfare of more than 10 million people.”

“Trying to be pragmatic, trying to be solution-oriented, is really what the Pantanal Declaration represents,” says Melissa Ho, WWF-US senior vice president for freshwater and food. Drawing on more than two decades of project-level experience in the Pantanal, WWF is working to support the initiative by facilitating the collaboration and by helping to strengthen the network of protected areas, support sustainable development, and foster responsible agricultural and ranching practices.

“We look at how to create solutions,” says Ho, “not just fight the threats.”

The Pantanal Declaration comes at a crucial moment. “There’s a window of opportunity for the Pantanal to survive into the future,” says Thieme. “This is a moment in time where development can take one of two different paths. If a sustainable path is taken, there’s an opportunity for that wealth of nature to continue to survive.”

### %SAVING THE PANTANAL: Wanted: Clean water

Throughout the Pantanal, the well-being of the region’s human communities is both increasingly under pressure and inextricably linked to the health of the freshwater system.

Take Sonia Ozuna Ortiz, for example. It takes her four hours to get from her village of Puerto Diana, Paraguay, to the forest where she and the other Yshir Indigenous women from her community collect the materials they use to make baskets. Ortiz learned the craft from her mother, who taught her how to weave the long strips of palm leaves using the tips of her fingers, pulling each knot tight before starting the next.

The women sell their baskets to visitors and in other towns along the Paraguay River. Ortiz earns 30,000 guaraníes ($5) for a small basket with handles that takes three days to make; a large laundry-style basket sells for 200,000 guaraníes ($31).

But getting to the forest isn’t always possible. In the rainy season, the only road connecting Puerto Diana to other Yshir communities and small towns that dot the bank of the Paraguay River is completely washed out. And even when the road is dry, the money Ortiz makes—together with what her husband makes by fishing and selling wood carvings—is often not enough to cover the most basic needs, such as drinking water.

The water the Yshirs drink comes directly from the Paraguay River. Pollution—including contamination from industrial activities, cattle, and even natural-but-dangerous bacteria from wildlife—means families must treat their water with chlorine, and that can be expensive.

Sometimes Ortiz and her husband don’t earn enough to treat the water their five daughters and three sons drink. The two 150-liter plastic barrels that sit in front of their house hold three days’ worth of water—and treating that water costs more than double what Ortiz makes in that amount of time.

Having a water treatment center in Puerto Diana, Ortiz says, would make an immense difference in her life. “It would be much easier,” she says. “We wouldn’t have to worry about buying anything if the water just came out of a tap.”

### %SAVING THE PANTANAL: Communicating a common vision

Finding sustainable solutions to community needs—for roads that are navigable year-round, for jobs, for clean water flowing from a tap—is a formidable challenge that requires a unified approach. And it’s one WWF is anxious to meet.

“The 2018 trinational declaration,” says WWF’s Thieme, “empowers Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay with a common vision for ensuring the future resilience of the Pantanal.” But realizing that vision will require collaborative, climate-smart approaches to sustainable development and conservation at every level, from the national to the local.

As the go-between for people in his community and authorities working on environmental issues, facilitator Saul Arias is a key link in how that vision plays out on the ground. He works for a partnership among WWF-Paraguay, Guyra Paraguay, and the Institute of Law and Environmental Economics.

Arias grew up in the town of Bahía Negra on the Paraguay River, not far from where Ortiz makes her baskets, and he knows well the challenges of life in the Pantanal. He travels back home frequently from the capital city of Asunción, where he is studying environmental engineering. When it’s not raining, he takes a 25-seat military plane. But if the rain washes out the runway, the only option is a four-day upriver trip on the Aquidaban, a cargo ferry prepped with hammocks and bunks for sleeping.

He has long been involved in conservation issues, and he works for a local organization to educate his community about sustainability. He runs an environmental radio station, gives regular talks at Bahía Negra’s elementary school, and works with the surrounding Indigenous communities to help them continue traditional practices, including Yshir basket weaving.

Bringing both his conservation knowledge and a deep involvement in his community to bear, Arias facilitates territorial planning aimed at determining the best uses for specific plots of land. Technicians in the field collect data on social and cultural issues, he explains, and look at the biodiversity and geography of each area to understand what can be done with it sustainably. Nature-based tourism in particular is an important ally for conservation and sustainable growth in the area.

Arias’s role is to talk with the community about the planning effort, and in turn to speak on their behalf as WWF, government authorities, and partners work to implement the sustainable development vision.

“At first a lot of people thought territorial planning was something negative,” he says. “But after a lot of time and long conversations, they understand that it will benefit them and help them keep their way of life, not hurt it.”

Arias’s community-centered work in Bahía Negra is a microcosm of WWF’s efforts across the region, says Thieme, “from addressing unsustainable ranching practices in the headwaters to mapping river connectivity and supporting renewable energy options that lessen the need for new dams.”

Such coordinated, science-based planning, she says, enables smart decision-making to address current threats to the health of the freshwater system and anticipate future needs. “It tells us, for example, where soy farming and ranching should go and which areas are key to protect.”

### %SAVING THE PANTANAL: Long-term commitment

The importance of preserving life in the Pantanal—and coordinated planning among the three countries—can’t be overstated, and the Pantanal Declaration affirms a level of commitment that buoys the hopes of those working to foster the resilience, adaptability, and prosperity of the region.

“It’s a work in progress,” says Melissa Ho. “This is a decades-long endeavor, and WWF has that commitment and staying power. This amazing landscape is worthy of our enduring protection for future generations.”

For Pantanal residents like Elizete Soares, that kind of commitment provides hope for the future of the only home they know. “The Pantanal, for us,” says Soares, “is everything.”

### %SAVING THE PANTANAL: SYSTEMS THINKING

The Pantanal is a uniquely dynamic ecosystem. Several ecoregions are woven together by the flow of water that journeys from higher terrain down to lower in the basin and ebbs and flows in these landscapes with the seasons. The complex nature of this vast region is what makes it so rich with biodiversity and with the natural resources that fuel economic activity—but also what makes it so challenging to conserve and develop sustainably.

The extensive circulation of water means that environmental changes in the surrounding regions directly affect the health of the Pantanal, and the health of the Pantanal directly affects the surrounding regions. Impacts in one place can cascade across the entire mosaic of communities and wildlife.

For instance, agricultural chemicals used in the Cerrado, the expansive savanna to the northeast, can be borne along by the Pantanal’s flood pulse and contaminate far-off bodies of water. And some threats, like the planned hidrovía, a massive waterway that would cut straight through the heart of the wetland, would fundamentally alter the Pantanal’s natural hydrological rhythms.

Systems-wide threats require systems-based solutions. Development in the Pantanal must be strategically planned in a coordinated effort across Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay in order to protect the region’s many ecosystem services. The transboundary cooperation and better protective measures to which the three countries committed in the 2018 Pantanal Declaration are critical to developing a more sustainable path forward for this globally significant freshwater resource.

WWF will continue to support and facilitate their efforts and to partner with farmers and ranchers, financial stakeholders, and communities to ensure that economic activity is balanced with the region’s diverse conservation priorities.

Our work on the ground has spanned national borders, ecoregions, and sectors for over 20 years. WWF is committed to embracing the Pantanal’s complexity as a living, flowing, interconnected system, so that it can one day be a model for sustainable development and good governance.
