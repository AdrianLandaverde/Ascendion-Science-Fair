# %SOUTHERN CHILE

Flanked by snowcapped volcanoes and Andean mountain peaks, the Southern Chile region is a diverse and remarkable place. The area encompasses parts of Chile and Argentina, as well as coastal waters off the coast of Chile.

The area’s Valdivian forests—South America’s only temperate rain forest—contain some of the world’s largest and oldest trees. Only 40 percent of the estimated 35 million acres of original forest remains intact today.

The Gulf of Corcovado is the fertile feeding and nursing grounds for blue whales—the world’s largest mammal. The waters are also home to numerous other marine species, including humpback, sei and sperm whales, sea lions, seals and several dolphin species.

CONTINENT: South America
SPECIES: Whale, Sea lion, Dolphins and porpoises, Great white shark

## %SPECIES

The isolated "island" quality of Southern Chile is reflected in the peculiarity of the species found here. About 50 percent of the flora is endemic—found nowhere else on Earth.

The area’s inhabitants include the endangered pudú also known as the world’s smallest deer, the magellanic woodpecker, and the opossum-like mountain monkey, considered to be a “living fossil.” Off the coast in the Gulf of Corcovado, there are 31 diverse marine mammal species and a dazzling abundance of sea birds. The region’s alerce tree can live for more than 3,000 years, making it the second longest-living organism on Earth.

The main species are:

- SEI WHALE
- WHALE
- BLUE WHALE
- DOLPHINS AND PORPOISES
- GREAT WHITE SHARK

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

Southern Chile is home to more than five million people, including indigenous groups such as the Pehuenche and Huilliche, who have lived there for thousands of years. Today, the lifestyles and local economies of many communities in the region rely heavily on the area’s native forests and marine life.

In 2007, after nearly a 20-year struggle for land rights, the Pehuenche community of the Andes range was rewarded with a grant of title to 22,000 acres of land in southern Chile. Also in 2007, the Huiliche community of Mapu Lahual received a prestigious Seal Award from Chilean president for their contribution to local development and conservation.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT
- UNSUSTAINABLE LOGGING AND CONVERSION OF HABITAT

### %THREATS: NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT

The expansion of industrial fishing and aquaculture activities in the Gulf of Corcovado are major threats. Over-exploitation, increased maritime traffic, trawling, and incidental bycatch all negatively impact the marine environment. Salmon farming and cultured mussel production, significant industries for Southern Chile, are negatively impacting fragile marine life. Additionally, climate change is already accelerating glacial melting and break-up in the region.

### %THREATS: UNSUSTAINABLE LOGGING AND CONVERSION OF HABITAT

Globalization and its effects are taking an extreme toll on the region's health. Weak regulatory and government enforcement capacity mean there is little defense against aggressive commercial development in the region. Unsustainable logging and conversion of habitat to plantations of pine and eucalyptus—used to create wood chips for export—have dramatically reduced native forest cover.

## %In northern Patagonia, Indigenous communities dive for seaweed and safeguard their coastline

When the seaweed divers of Guafo Island return to the surface, it’s as if they’ve come back from some distant planet. Three men heave their slippery bodies onto a fishing vessel, like dazed aquanauts, dressed from boot to hood in thick black wetsuits to endure the chill of maritime Patagonia. It’s only lunchtime, but these tired men have been underwater so long already that their faces are shriveled like prunes.

“It’s a tough life out here,” says the captain of the Cobra vessel, Manuel Vidal, who, at 57, has spent the past four decades working off the coast of this remote Chilean island. He comes to sustainably harvest a flat, leathery, maroon-colored seaweed called luga. The luga season begins each year in October and ends in March. During that time, dozens of boats like Cobra take men eight hours away from the port of Quellón for multi-week shifts out at sea.

All morning, these divers have been connected to 450-foot oxygen hoses, plying the ocean floor 30 feet below. They’ve gathered seaweed into nets and surfaced – only briefly every half-hour or so – to deliver the 150-pound loads to Vidal before descending once again into the murky Eastern South Pacific. Most of this luga will eventually make its way into either the cosmetics industry or carrageenan (a thickening agent for the food industry).

### %In northern Patagonia, Indigenous communities dive for seaweed and safeguard their coastline: Seaweed Scarcity

When Vidal first got into this line of work, he says he could load the hull with seaweed in about four days. Now, due to overextraction, it takes an average of 10 days, meaning he and others must live onboard in their rudimentary shelters for longer periods of time. That’s why 11 Quellón-based fishing syndicates have thrown their support behind a group of 10 local Indigenous communities fighting to safeguard these waters.

The plan is to designate Guafo as an 870-square-mile Coastal Marine Space for Indigenous People, an initiative supported by the WWF, that would offer greater protections for the coastline, including who can access it and where and when they can extract its resources. Approval could come as soon as the year’s end, not a moment too soon for artisanal fisherman like Vidal who rely on it for their livelihoods.

“There are areas where there is basically nothing left to harvest,” Vidal says after winching up the latest net of seaweed. “I think that a good coordination [on the Coastal Marine Space for Indigenous People (ECMPO for its Spanish acronym)] would be great for the future, for the people that come after us, so they can have something, too.”  

### %In northern Patagonia, Indigenous communities dive for seaweed and safeguard their coastline: Following tradition into the future

Just across the bay at Caleta Arrayán, on another fishing vessel, are two teenage divers who’ve followed their fathers into the industry. “This work goes back generations,” says Damián Gueicha, 17, who monitors the oxygen hose for his 38-year-old father, Adán, down below. “Almost everyone in my family works in the sea, mostly in diving.”

Gueicha learned to dive when he was 12 years old and says he and his cousin are (now that they’re old enough to work summer jobs) among the few young people out on these boats. Once he graduates from high school next year, he plans to enter the industry full-time. “I’m dedicating myself to this life,” he says, sipping on the stimulating tea yerba mate, which divers drink for energy.

This season is his first at Guafo, and it’s been an eye-opener. “Closer to Quellón the luga is very scarce, but here there is much more,” he explains as a skua bird circles above the boat, inspecting the latest catch. “Guafo really stands out to me because it’s an island that always gives. You can keep coming back and it has more to offer.”

The teenager may not have seen this place when it was giving even more than it gives now, but Guafo nevertheless remains one of the more pristine spots in northern Chilean Patagonia for fishing families like the Gueichas and Vidals. The hope is that, with new protections, it will stay that way for future generations, too.

## %A corridor for blue whales, humpbacks, and more marine wildlife

There’s an old whaling station from the 1920s hidden in a temperate rainforest on the remote Patagonian outpost of Guafo Island. Its rickety bones have, in recent decades, mostly disappeared, but if you look closely, you can still make out fallen chimneys, scattered boiler bricks and ghostly foundations of long-gone buildings – all of which call to mind an era when some whale species were hunted to near extinction.

The plant’s location here was no accident. Guafo lies in the Gulf of Corcovado, a vast waterway separating mainland Chile from the much larger Chiloé Island. Thanks to freshwater input from melting Andean glaciers, it has the perfect conditions for an abundance of krill, making it the most important feeding and breeding grounds in the Eastern South Pacific for blue whales. It’s also a frequent stop in the austral summer for other cetaceans, including humpbacks, orcas, sei and southern right whale

Today, in 2023, this corridor once known for the pillaging of animals, is now teeming with them. That’s why Yaqueline Montecinos, Marine Biodiversity and Ocean Policy Coordinator at WWF Chile, has moored a research vessel near the old whaling station. Within an hour of arriving in a nearby fishing cove, she spots a distant spout. Then, a humpback whale emerges from the steel-blue waters, carving a path in and out of waves along the cloudy horizon. A few minutes later, it even wows her with cinematic acrobatics.

“This place is home to such a massive amount of biodiversity,” she says from the vessel’s bow as sea lions bound down slippery rocks and a pod of Peale's dolphins scurries nearby. Another humpback rises from the distant sea before slapping its white-tipped tail, launching a burst of oceanic fireworks.

Blue whales, though present, prove harder to find – even though they’re the largest (and loudest) animals on Earth, weighing close to 200 tons. Before whaling, it’s estimated that there may have been as many as 250,000 of them roaming the oceans each day in search of the four tons of krill needed to survive. Now, they number anywhere from 10,000 to 25,000, making them among the most endangered great whales on Earth.

Their recovery is notoriously slow. Yet, new protections in Chile might aid in the process. Last July, the government created a 394-square-mile Marine Protected Area in the Gulf of Corcovado: The Tic-Toc Golfo Corcovado Marine Park. Though a management plan is still forthcoming, it’s hoped that it can include measures to limit shipping traffic, much of it for industrial fishing and aquaculture operations. Shipping traffic poses the whales’ biggest modern threats here, both for collisions and noise pollution, which impedes communication and breeding habits.

Other conservation initiatives are similarly under way to protect a wider swath of the whales’ habitat. Ten Indigenous communities, with the support of the WWF, are working to create an 870-square-mile indigenous people protected area around Guafo known as a Coastal- Marine Space for Indigenous People (ECMPO for its Spanish acronym), which would be administered by members of the local Huilliche community. Two of them have joined Montecinos on her trip to Guafo and speak of ancestors who, out of necessity, worked here in the whaling industry.

Montecinos says the location of the proposed ECMPO is as strategic as that old whaling station. “You can imagine it as the gateway to the Gulf of Corcovado from the Pacific Ocean,” she explains. “So, if we have conservation protection and conservation actions planned here, we should have a positive impact on all of the whales that navigate through the Gulf of Corcovado.”

The marine biologist spends five days at Guafo, watching as the humpbacks return nearly every day to the same spots at similar times. She heads off in a dinghy with the Huilliche delegation to see the creatures they’re both trying to protect, all the while discussing how the WWF can further support the Coastal Marine Space for Indigenous People initiative.

“This is such an intact area,” she says on the final day, sitting on a sandy Guafo beach eight-hours by boat from the nearest town. “The intervention from human activity is so little, so I think it’s still possible to preserve what we have and to be able to keep it as it is.”

## %How community and Indigenous efforts contribute to protecting our oceans

Our ocean’s spectacular wildlife and plant life are at risk as biodiversity around the world teeters on the brink of irreversible loss. But the world is coming together to take action. To reverse nature loss, the Convention on Biological Diversity, a United Nations treaty focused on ecosystems, species, and genetic resources, has adopted an agreement to protect 30% of land, freshwater, and oceans by 2030—an effort commonly known as “30x30.” 

Clearly, change is needed to protect our ocean’s incredible wildlife, but we also need to ensure that such protection doesn’t cut off access to the ocean’s many varied resources for the hundreds of millions of people who depend on them.

While marine protected areas are the most well-known pathway to protect marine life and can incorporate community resource needs, there are other solutions that can also support both people and nature living along coasts. Those involved in ocean conservation are increasingly turning toward one such solution known as ‘other effective conservation measures’ (OECMs) to work alongside marine protected areas as complementary pathways that protect our ocean ecosystems. OECMs are geographic sites that are not within a protected area, that deliver long-term biodiversity conservation under equitable governance and management. They embrace the power and importance of local community involvement in protecting ocean ecosystems and recognize that many people already integrate conservation actions into their lives through religious or traditional preservation. With the community’s consent, governments can formally recognize these actions as OECMs, which could not only give legal recognition of Indigenous and community rights to the area but also count towards global biodiversity conservation targets such as 30x30.

WWF is working with coastal communities in Chile, Ecuador, and many other countries to encourage governments to formally recognize this community-led work, legitimize community and Indigenous actions, and support the protection of our ocean wildlife.

### %How community and Indigenous efforts contribute to protecting our oceans: Chile

On the Pacific coast of Northern Patagonia, about 24.85 miles from Chile’s Chiloé archipelago, lies a 50,000-acre island known as Guafo. Its position in the Gulf of Corcovado makes the island a critical habitat for migratory whales, dolphins, sea lions, sea birds, and other marine life—and a site of cultural and spiritual significance to the Indigenous Mapuche Hillichue communities of southern Chiloé.

The cultural and natural importance of Guafo has motivated a group of 11 Indigenous communities of Chiloé to promote the initiative "Wuafo Wapi, ancestral territory for conservation." Wuafo Wapi seeks the declaration of a Coastal Marine Area of Original Peoples (ECMPO) in Guafo, the establishment of which would block any development that could be detrimental to the cultural, ecological, and ecosystem characteristics in the designated area. The proposal was officially presented to the National Corporation for Indigenous Development with the technical support of WWF Chile and approved by Chile’s Undersecretary of Fisheries and Aquaculture. WWF is currently exploring how the OECM mechanism can bring a more inclusive and Indigenous-led approach to marine coastal conservation for the communities of Chiloé.

### %How community and Indigenous efforts contribute to protecting our oceans: Ecuador

Ecuador has rich and plentiful marine life which is, in part, thanks to the mangroves that line 61% of the country’s coastline. The coastal trees lock down sediment under their tangled roots, preventing it from smothering corals—home to important fishing grounds and a hotspot for biodiversity. The roots also provide shelter for shellfish as well as young juvenile fish, giving them a safe space to live until they grow large enough to venture out into open water and join the larger food web that supports a $5.5 billion industry in fish exports alone. These magnificent trees also store carbon, making them hugely important in curbing global warming, and protecting coastlines from storms. 

Despite these benefits, Ecuador’s mangroves are threatened by clear-cutting for illegal and unsustainable shrimp farming. To protect the largest stretch of mangrove forest while also allowing sustainable resource use, the government has conceded mangrove land rights to communities in the Gulf of Guayaquil so that they have the legal protection to continue traditional and sustainable harvest of mangrove crabs while also helping to report any clear-cutting to law enforcement. This mangrove concessions concept has the potential to be categorized as an OECM in the future and attain formal recognition by the government as Ecuador calculates its contributions to 30x30. The benefits of the program can be two-fold: protecting the mangrove ecosystems and directly benefiting people. However, more work is still needed to protect crabbing communities as interactions with pirates or shrimp farmers can become deadly.

## %INFINITE DEPTHS

The Don Luciano, a weather-beaten 45-foot fishing boat, motors out of Cocholgüe harbor in the early morning darkness. Behind the vessel, the houses of the village spill down the steep hillside toward the rocky harbor, where a narrow beach is lined by brightly painted boats in various states of repair. Cocholgüe, a cove on Chile’s central coast, is home to roughly 2,000 fishermen and their families. As Captain Fabian Rodriguez steers, his crew of six snoozes in cramped bunks despite the deafening diesel engine. The Don Luciano is one of the larger examples of Chile’s 9,300 artisanal fishing boats, which brought in 1.3 million tons of seafood in 2012.

The crew members emerge onto the rolling deck with the rising sun and pull on bright orange overalls and jackets and turquoise gloves. A beach ball-sized float marks the first set of gillnets, which are 200 feet long and suspended 10 feet above the seafloor. A muscular choreography begins: two men pull up the nylon nets, using a motorized winch when arm strength isn’t enough; two more disentangle hake that have been snagged by their gills (hence the term “gillnet”); and two coil the ropes and stack the empty nets.

The piles of fish grow, but painfully slowly, as seagulls bob in the swells and pelicans glide past in military formation. When the process is finished two hours later, the men reset the nets and use buckets of seawater to sluice fish slime from the decks and each other. The next set of nets is even more disappointing, with gaping holes left by boat anchors, stiff currents, or maybe sea lions.

Rodriguez shakes his head as he steers toward home around noon. Today’s catch looks to be about 15 boxes, each holding 60 pounds of fish, which will earn each man about $10. Rodriguez, a fisherman for 20 years, remembers when an average haul was 30 to 40 boxes. “You very rarely had a small catch, but not now,” he says. “These last few years it’s been low.”

Chile’s seafood industry, the sixth largest in the world, includes everything from tiny fishing boats and huge industrial trawlers to seething fish farms and aseptic factories. It’s a microcosm of the problems and potential solutions facing global fisheries, as stocks face collapse even as every year brings millions more mouths to feed. But with help from WWF—and with a newly amended fishery law, for which WWF gave input—the country is edging toward sustainability. “We’re on the right track,” says Ricardo Bosshard, WWF’s Chile director. “But we know we’re on a journey of 10 years, maybe more.”

Three billion people rely on seafood, both wild-caught and farmed, as their main source of animal protein. The industry supports 200 million jobs, making seafood one of the world’s biggest traded food commodities.

But that bounty has come at a price. Over 85% of marine fish stocks are considered either fully exploited or overfished, and more than one in five fisheries has collapsed. Climate change is altering the distribution of fish by acidifying the oceans and raising water temperatures. With more than 9 billion people estimated to crowd the planet by 2050, the continuing role of fish as food is becoming less and less secure.

Sandwiched in large part between the Andes and the Pacific, Chile is a coastline as much as a country, with more oceanfront real estate than the east and west coasts of the US combined. Seafood is the country’s third-largest export, but after decades of mismanagement, over two-thirds of Chile’s commercial bony-fish stocks are currently overexploited or collapsed, says Mauricio Galvez, WWF Chile’s Fisheries Program coordinator. “It is not only an environmental or economic issue. There are thousands of vulnerable people who directly depend on such stocks.”

The decline is in evidence in places like Cocholgüe. Antonio Bustos, president of the local fishermen’s union, is a bear of a man with a handshake toughened by decades at sea. “I’m a dignified man,” he says. “I don’t want to live off of handouts. I want to work and earn my money.” But it’s getting harder and harder to make ends meet, he says, with prices falling and the fish getting smaller and harder to find every year. “Our kids don’t want to be fishermen anymore.”

Many artisanal fishermen blame large industrial vessels (defined as boats more than 60 feet long) for the dwindling catches. They say these big boats fish indiscriminately beyond about five nautical miles out—but still within the historical artisanal fishing grounds—and misreport their catch. In 2012, 175 registered industrial vessels caught nearly as much as Chile’s entire artisanal fleet. Unregulated artisanal fishing is also a problem, says Bustos. Illegally caught hake sell for roughly $10 per box versus the $20-$30 that legal fishermen have to charge to cover costs. “Our legal catch is better-quality, bigger fish,” says Bustos. But given that price competition, law-abiding fishermen struggle to make a profit.

On top of that are the fishing quotas the government instituted in 2001 to try and save the country’s crashing stocks. “The quotas are so small you can’t make a living,” Bustos says—and some fishermen simply ignore them. Meanwhile, the fish keep getting smaller. Over the past decade, the median size for mature hake has reportedly dropped from 14.5 inches to 11 inches. “Twenty or 30 fish used to fill a box,” Bustos says. “Now it takes 80 or 90. One hake fillet used to cover a plate, and now you need two.”

Bustos says it would help if the government promoted higher hake prices and provided fishermen with gear to catch different species in different seasons. Having their own fish processing plant, he suggests, would help the residents of Cocholgüe and other caletas (local associations of fishermen) connect directly with international markets, as industrial operations do.

Dante Queirolo of the Pontifical Catholic University School of Marine Sciences in Valparaiso agrees that the hake fishery is in bad shape, and that illegal and unreported fishing is a serious problem. “People cheat,” he says. “We need to recognize that the monitoring system has failed.” To address this, the Chilean National Fisheries Service (Sernapesca) launched a new landing certification program this year to record how many fish are being caught by artisanal boats over 40 feet long.

The new landing certifications are part of an overhaul of Chile’s national fishing law, which went into effect in February 2013. WWF advocated for improvements in the law that focus on conservation and sustainability, including setting up legally binding fishery recovery and management plans, and using a transparent, science-backed process to set the yearly quotas.

One of the best places to find fish for domestic consumption is in Santiago’s fish market, built in 1996 with a grant from Japan. It’s the largest of its kind in the country, with over 1,000 tons of seafood sold every month, and it rumbles with activity starting well before dawn. Burly workers unload boxes of fish from trucks as vendors sell coffee and snacks out of shopping carts. Early morning buyers stroll between stalls looking for deals on every kind of seafood imaginable: salmon and giant squid, crabs and elephant fish, a whole octopus here, half a swordfish there. The smell is overwhelming, almost a visible haze in the air.

As the morning progresses, more shoppers arrive to haggle over ingredients for dinner or linger at a lunch counter over a thick bowl of caldillo de congrio, a traditional Chilean conger eel stew that’s known locally as a hangover cure.

The market reflects a vibrant slice of Chile’s economy, which in turn is only part of a much larger picture. Together, Chile, Peru and Argentina provide about 9% of the world’s total catch in two main categories: whitefish such as Patagonian toothfish (aka Chilean sea bass) and species low on the food chain like Peruvian anchoveta, used for fish oil and animal feed. Many of these stocks are in bad shape, which is why WWF helped establish the Southern Cone Alliance, a marine initiative aimed at long-term sustainability, in 2013.

WWF marine and fisheries offices in Chile and Peru, together with Argentina’s Fundación Vida Silvestre, a partner organization, are collaborating to ensure that the region’s fish are harvested at biologically safe and sustainable levels, without undue environmental impacts. The goal is to have three-quarters of priority fisheries certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) by 2020.

But wild fisheries are still struggling, and one way to take some of the pressure off is to farm fish instead. Six hundred miles south of Santiago, where Chile’s geography starts to dissolve into a fractal maze of mountains and water, a grid of metal walkways floats in a channel near the city of Puerto Montt. Under a gloomy sky, a worker in a rain jacket and rubber boots tosses food pellets into one of 10 pens, open on the surface but contained by underwater netting, that form the structure. The surface boils, evoking images of piranhas and unlucky swimmers. Here, though, it’s two-week-old coho salmon: 50,000 in each 10,000-square-foot pen, to be exact, or half a million fish in less than two and a half acres.

Workers, who live in floating buildings nearby, monitor their charges through underwater cameras and speak about them almost as if they were children. “If they’re not eating, something isn’t right,” says Francisco Elgueta Diaz, operations manager for the Chiloé plant of AquaChile, the country’s largest salmon exporter. Sometimes they have to vaccinate every fish, individually, by hand.

Aquaculture has been practiced for thousands of years, starting in ancient China, but it wasn’t until the mid-20th century that “fish farming” grew into a truly large-scale food source. Today it’s the fastest-growing part of the world food economy, accounting for about a third of all fish consumed.

In Chile, aquaculture is a $5 billion industry, with 2,300 active operations employing 120,000 people directly or indirectly. The country is the second-largest producer of farmed salmon after Norway but, as it has elsewhere, the aquaculture industry has drawn criticism for polluting and otherwise disturbing natural habitats and ecosystems.

Those negative impacts can also spread. Crowded underwater pens can contaminate their surroundings with feces and food pellets (often made, ironically, from wild-caught fish). Escaped fish can spread disease and out-compete native species. In many areas, the ships that supply the farms and feeding-machine generators create constant noise, which may be short-circuiting cetacean communications and driving away marine mammals like the Chilean dolphin. And the sometimes-heavy use of antibiotics is thought by some to increase antibiotic resistance in people.

To top it off, in 2007 an outbreak of the Infectious Salmon Anemia virus (ISA) rocked Chile’s aquaculture industry, causing production to plunge by 40% and dovetailing with the worldwide economic crisis to cause widespread unemployment in areas where fishing is a way of life.

AquaChile is one of two salmon producers that have worked directly with WWF to improve the sustainability of their operations. They’re also part of the Global Salmon Initiative, an agreement announced in August 2013 by 15 of the world’s leading salmon farming companies to have their farms ready for certification by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) by 2020. That would mean 70% of the world’s farmed salmon would be independently evaluated to meet strict standards of environmental, economic and social benefits.

“In the salmon industry, it’s not enough that one company does things right,” says Nico Nicolaides, AquaChile’s chief operations manager. “We all have to do things right. There are no boundaries in the sea.”

Salmon farming has recovered to pre-ISA levels, but AquaChile is taking no chances. All visitors to the fish farms have to follow strict sanitation rules, washing their hands and spraying rubber boots with disinfectant on arrival and again on departure. Researchers are also trying to develop a vaccine against a rickettsia-based disease prevalent in Chile, which would let fish farms cut back on their use of antibiotics significantly.

The aquaculture company Cermaq, another major player in Chile’s salmon farming industry, is working on ways to eliminate destructive salmon parasites like sea lice. A long-term view is key in this industry, says CEO Francisco Miranda Morales. “You can have a very profitable business in a very short time period. But that’s not going to last. When biology is involved, what you do today will affect the future.”

The future, or at least part of it, is on view at the AquaChile processing plant in Puerto Montt. Workers sign in with fingerprint readers and suit up in full-body smocks with boots, hoods and face masks. (They also disinfect carefully before entering; the ISA outbreak left the plant fishless and shuttered for three years.)

Inside, the plant is cold and humming with machinery and precision activity, like a high-speed industrial operating room smelling of chlorine and salt. Farmed salmon arrive by tanker truck and come through large hoses into the gutting room, the only part of the factory where workers wear red uniforms. From there the fish are carried by conveyor belts through high-tech slicing machines and hand-trimming stations where workers with chainmail gloves work like skilled surgeons. The fish are sorted, cut, de-scaled and filleted, emerging at the other end in vacuum-sealed sections that are packed into Styrofoam boxes and whisked off for shipment around the world. “They can be in the US in 48 hours by plane, farm to table,” says plant manager Gerardo Crot Rebolledo, clearly proud of the operation.

It’s strange to think that these flash-frozen fillets were swimming in the chilly southeastern Pacific just days ago. The transformation reflects the two important roles fish play in the modern world, as living creatures and as commodities.

At the entrance to Cocholgüe, where the Don Luciano plies the water nearly every day, is a sign bearing a poem by the Chilean writer Francisco Coloane. “All life comes from the sea,” it says. “There is an infinity in the depth of the ocean that man does not yet know.”

What we do know, however, is that safeguarding fisheries has a ripple effect on the entire marine environment, affecting everything from seabirds and sea turtles to marine mammals such as fur seals and dolphins. Healthy ocean ecosystems are more resilient to emerging threats such as warming water temperatures and ocean acidification. Making fisheries sustainable over the long term is critical for the billions of people who depend on fish for their food and livelihoods. Still, human actions have altered the bounty of fish once found in the ocean depths: we have made that seemingly endless bounty finite. That’s where WWF’s experience working on complicated issues from all sides comes into play, says Bosshard. To solve this challenge, he adds, “we must try to engage with what is really, really complex.”
