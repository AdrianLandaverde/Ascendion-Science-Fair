# %AMUR-HEILONG

The Amur-Heilong covers areas of northeastern China and the Russian Far East. The region contains one of the most biologically diverse temperate forests in the world, vast steppe grasslands, and the unbroken taiga biome.

The area consists of the 380-million-acre watershed of the Amur River—the longest undammed river in the Eastern Hemisphere—which creates a natural border between China and Russia. This great river originates near the sacred mountain of Burkan Khaldun in northeastern Mongolia, the birthplace of Genghis Khan.

CONTINENT: Asia
SPECIES: Amur tiger, Amur leopard

## %SPECIES

The Amur-Heilong harbors an incredible variety of species. Some 2,800 plant and 500 animal species inhabit the Russian side of the river alone. The area is a key habitat for some critically endangered wildlife such as the Amur tiger and the Amur leopard, which sits perilously close to the brink of extinction.

The old-growth deciduous and coniferous forests are also home to musk deer and brown bears. And the wetland ecosystems of the Amur-Heilong offer important refuge for migratory waterfowl, such as Oriental white storks and red-crowned cranes. The Amur River is home to the world's largest salmon, the 150-pound Siberian taimen. Wild ginseng, treasured for its healing powers, grows across the Russian Far East portion of the region.

The main species is the AMUR LEOPARD.

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

Rapid population growth in northeastern China is putting pressure on indigenous ethnic groups who have lived for centuries in the Amur-Heilong Basin, such as the Owenk, Hezhe, and Kirgiz. Far fewer people live on the Russian side of the river, which is home to European and Russian immigrants and indigenous groups such as the Nanai and Udege, who depend on the rivers and forests for their livelihoods.

One of the region's largest conservation challenges is balancing economic development with achieving sustainable land use, keeping the needs of indigenous people in mind. Traditional lifestyles in the area are often based on fishing and are now severely threatened by the decline in fish stocks and water pollution.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- HABITAT DESTRUCTION
- ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

### %THREATS: HABITAT DESTRUCTION

Dams, pollution, and habitat destruction all threaten the health of the Amur-Heilong Basin. In addition to local pressures, this fragile ecosystem is imperiled by the international demand for timber, energy and animal products. Recent climatic trends are reshaping migration routes and alternating weather patterns that impact the health of local wildlife.

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

While poaching has declined in recent years thanks to enforcement efforts, enthusiasm for traditional Chinese medicine still feeds a booming wildlife trade in products such as bear gall bladder, tiger paw and ginseng.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

They are:

- PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
- ENSURING THE RIVER’S NATURAL FLOW
- PROTECTING THE RIVER’S HEADWATERS
- RESTORING HABITATS AND PROTECTING SPECIES

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY

With the help of our Global Forest and Trade Network, WWF works to facilitate trade between companies committed to responsible forestry practices.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ENSURING THE RIVER’S NATURAL FLOW

WWF works with governments at all levels to urge adoption of a proposal for hydropower energy development that strikes a sustainable balance between the needs of humans and the region’s ecological integrity.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING THE RIVER’S HEADWATERS

In Mongolia, WWF works with partners to improve land reclamation and restoration practices. We also implement ecotourism programs that encourage conservation while providing local economies with revenue.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: RESTORING HABITATS AND PROTECTING SPECIES

In Russia and China, WWF is creating a multinational protected area for leopards, establishing national parks, and expanding tiger habitats.

## %Mongolia protects millions of acres of freshwater ecosystem

More than 3.2. million acres are now designated as national protected areas in Mongolia. With this new addition, Mongolia has officially protected 21% of its overall territory.

Formally designated just last month, the newly protected areas span eight provinces and include 2.5 million acres of freshwater ecosystems—including critical breeding grounds for migratory birds like the vulnerable white-naped crane,[i] and large swaths of the Onon river watershed. These protections prevent mines, dams, and other development that would pollute, fragment, and alter the natural flow of nutrients and resources throughout the region.

Mongolia’s protection of the Onon river is particularly important because it is one of only two sources of the Amur River—the ninth-longest free-flowing river in the world that supports millions of people in communities across Mongolia, China, and Russia. Clean, free-flowing rivers are essential to shelter freshwater wildlife species; provide local access to safe drinking water, and fishing for people along the river basin; carry nutrient rich sediment to agricultural floodplains; and provide a buffer against the impact of extreme flooding.

Unfortunately, more than two thirds of the planet’s long rivers are fragmented by dams, roads, and development. Recently, WWF and others have found that even some of the world’s protected freshwater areas are now under threat. Humans have impacted freshwater ecosystems so intensely over the past 50 years that WWF’s Living Planet Report estimates that freshwater species populations have declined by 83% since 1970.

WWF is determined to reverse these trends. Mongolia’s success is the result of WWF-Mongolia’s 12 years of advocacy and research, and represents only a small portion of WWF’s freshwater work. In communities around the world, WWF is strengthening legal protections, developing renewable alternatives to hydropower energy, stopping poorly-planned dams, and promoting sustainable development to support the people and wildlife that rely on freshwater ecosystems.

## %Nine wins for tigers in the last nine years

Cats, it’s said, have nine lives. But just nine years ago, the world’s biggest cat – the tiger – had all but used them up. Logging and land clearance had eliminated 95% of the tiger’s historic range and poaching to supply the illegal trade in tiger body parts had driven many populations to the edge of extinction. In 2010, an estimated 3,200 tigers were left in the wild, a dramatic decline from a century ago when perhaps 100,000 tigers prowled the forests, grasslands and savannahs of Asia.

Alarmed by this decline and its implications for biodiversity, representatives from the 13 nations* where tigers still survived came to St. Petersburg, Russia, in November 2010, for an extraordinary summit; the first to bring together tiger range states, funders such as the US government and the World Bank, and major NGOs such as WWF, to save a single species: the tiger. The result was a pledge to double the number of wild tigers by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger on the Chinese lunar calendar. Dubbed Tx2, it is arguably the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to recover an endangered species. Today, there are strong signs that the overall tiger population decline has begun to reverse, with better data and improved surveys indicating there are likely now close to 4,000 tigers roaming free across the range states.

Here are nine top Tx2 achievements to date:

1) Amur tigers: Siberian tigers – the biggest of all cats – live in the border lands between Russia and northeastern China. In 2013, under Tx2, China and Russia agreed to coordinate their efforts to protect them. They had not been seen on China’s side of the border since the 1940’s. Thanks to significant investments in tiger conservation by both Russia and China, in 2015, a WWF camera trap recorded images of a mother and her playful cubs 20 miles inside the Chinese border. The distance is significant because the cubs could not have travelled that far across the border on their own – which means they were born and raised in China. The latest data show that around 21 Siberian tigers now call China home. And China announced plans in 2017 to create a major new national park in its northeastern province of Heilongjiang to further the conservation of tigers and other threatened species.

2) India: Home to perhaps two-thirds of the world’s wild tigers, India recently completed a year-long survey that counted 2,967 tigers, and there are indications that numerous tiger populations in the country may be stable or growing. The Indian Government is leading the way in tiger conservation investments, and the results are paying off.

3) Nepal: This tiny Himalayan country has emerged as the Usain Bolt of tiger conservation, setting the Tx2 pace for others to follow. Based on the latest government survey data, there are an estimated 235 tigers in Nepal – almost twice 2009’s number – putting Nepal on track to be the first range state to double its tiger population since the St. Petersburg summit.

4) Bhutan: A 2015 survey in this rugged, mountainous kingdom reported a population of 103 tigers – a nearly 30% increase over the previous estimate of 75. In Royal Manas Park, the latest census counted 22 tigers at the beginning of 2018, up from 10 in 2010.

5) Russia: In addition to hosting the Tx2 summit in 2010 and cooperating with China to conserve Siberian tigers, Russia in 2015 established Bikin National Park – a vast 2.86 million acre (1.16 m hectare) expanse that extends a chain of protected areas now covering 70% of the tiger’s habitat in the Russian Far East.

6) Thailand: The world’s second breeding population of Indochinese tigers was discovered in 2017 in Thailand’s Dong-Phayayen Khao Forest Complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site in northeast Thailand. Footage from camera traps installed by the Thai government, with conservation partners Panthera and Freeland Foundation, indicates that at least 18 tigers, including six cubs, now reside in the Eastern forest complex for the first time in 15 years.

7) Other range states – Cambodia and Kazakhstan are working closely with WWF and others on bold plans to bring tigers back to their territories. In 2017, Cambodia was the first range state to acknowledge the extirpation of its tigers (the last was seen there in 2007) and make an ambitious pledge to re-introduce them in its Eastern Plains Landscape. Kazakhstan, while not a Tx2 signatory, has established a 988,100 acres reserve that WWF is helping them create for the return of tigers to their former central Asian range for the first time in 70 years.

8) Safe Havens: In 2017, conservation stakeholders came together to form the Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA/TS) Partnership to help secure and support safe havens for tigers. A set of detailed standards and criteria for managing tiger landscapes, CA/TS gives stakeholders a way to monitor, assess and compare the progress of conservation efforts in protected areas under their jurisdiction

9) US captive tigers: Some 5,000 tigers—more than exist in the wild—are held by private owners who in many cases are neither monitored nor trained to care for them. This lack of legal oversight allows the potential for illegal tiger trade. In 2016, the US Fish & Wildlife Service took an initial step by requiring owners to obtain interstate commerce permits before selling a tiger across state lines. And the Big Cat Public Safety Act was introduced in Congress earlier in 2019 and would go one step further by restricting tiger ownership only to facilities such as sanctuaries or accredited zoos – hopeful progress toward eliminating “backyard tigers.”

### %Nine wins for tigers in the last nine years: The future of Tx2

Will we get to 6,000 in the 36 months remaining until the end of the next Year of the Tiger? It is a daunting challenge, and tigers are still in crisis in many parts of their range. But Tx2 was in many ways an aspirational goal, and the question is really not IF, but WHEN – as the best science indicates that achieving Tx2 IS possible. And we know that what we’re doing works; close enough to know that, with the political will and help of our partners in the field and supporters around the world, we can do this.

## %SEVEN UNSUNG ECOSYSTEMS WE NEED TO SURVIVE

They may not be household names, like the Amazon rainforest or the Great Barrier Reef. But these forests, grasslands, savannas, and other ecosystems are just as vital to the health of our planet. They support an incredible range of plants and animals, as well as millions of people and their communities.

They also play a critical role in fighting climate change, helping regulate the Earth’s temperature and natural cycles by pulling harmful, heat-trapping CO2 out of the atmosphere. Explore some of the lesser-known ecosystems that do so much to keep our planet livable:

- Cerrado savanna
- Miombo woodlands
- Amur-Heilong landscape
- Greater Mekong region
- New Guinea’s forests
- Forests of eastern Australia
- Northern Great Plains

### %SEVEN UNSUNG ECOSYSTEMS WE NEED TO SURVIVE: Cerrado savanna

When it comes to forests, the Amazon rainforest usually grabs the spotlight. But the nearby Cerrado, a wooded grassland covering more than 20% of Brazil, is equally important. It’s the world’s most biodiverse savanna, home to an astonishing 5% of the Earth’s plants and animals. Jaguars, giant anteaters, maned wolves, and armadillos live within this ecosystem, which also provides essential services to local communities and stores immense amounts of carbon in the ground.

In recent decades, agircultural expansion for beef and soy production has driven rapid deforestation across the region. As grasslands are plowed up, they release an estimated 250 million tons of greenhouse gases annually—the equivalent of burning 28 billion gallons of gasoline.

WWF partners with some of the world’s largest food companies, as well as local farmers, to halt deforestation in the Cerrado and to promote sustainable soy production.

### %SEVEN UNSUNG ECOSYSTEMS WE NEED TO SURVIVE: Miombo woodlands

Elephants, rhinos, giraffes, zebras and other wildlife roam the Miombo woodlands, which cover much of central and southern Africa. This unique ecosystem, named for the area’s many “miombo” trees, is about twice the size of Alaska and is made up of tropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands. Although the Miombo is still relatively intact and sparsely settled, these natural woodlands are increasingly threatened by development for agriculture, ranching, and charcoal production.

When trees are cleared and burned, carbon is released into the atmosphere and the land is less able to re-absorb greenhouse gases. WWF is working to conserve these important woodlands and help local communities use their natural resources more sustainably.

### %SEVEN UNSUNG ECOSYSTEMS WE NEED TO SURVIVE: Amur-Heilong landscape

Straddling the border of China and Russia, the Amur-Heilong is one of the most biologically diverse temperate forests in the world. About the size of Texas, this mixed woodland-grassland landscape is home to the world’s most endangered large cat, the Amur leopard, as well as a population of endangered Amur tigers. In addition to harboring a remarkable variety of plant and animal species, the landscape includes the 380-million-acre watershed of the Amur River—the longest undammed river in the Eastern Hemisphere.

But this landscape now faces mounting pressures from deforestation and infrastructure development, which pose huge threats to local wildlife and their environment. Throughout the Amur-Heilong, WWF helps to protect species by connecting important wildlife corridors and safeguarding essential habitat against illegal logging and other destructive activities.

### %SEVEN UNSUNG ECOSYSTEMS WE NEED TO SURVIVE: Greater Mekong region

Few places on earth are as biodiverse or ecologically important as the Greater Mekong region. Stretching from the Tibetan plateau to the shores of Vietnam, this spectacular ecosystem features an abundance of rare wildlife, mangrove forests that protect coastal communities, and the largest combined tiger habitat in the world. It also supports the world’s largest inland fishery, an essential source of food and income for the river basin's 70 million people.

In the last 50 years, though, the Greater Mekong region has lost more than a third of its forests due to agricultural expansion and economic development. Fewer than 250 million acres of the region’s forest now remain, while tens of millions of additional acres are projected to disappear by 2030. The region’s fragile river systems are also severely threatened by infrastructure projects, such as dams for hydropower, which could devastate freshwater species and the communities that rely on rivers to live.

Along with governments and communities, we support the sustainable use of land and freshwater resources across the Greater Mekong while spearheading efforts to protect its rich biodiversity.

### %SEVEN UNSUNG ECOSYSTEMS WE NEED TO SURVIVE: New Guinea’s forests

After the Amazon and Congo, the rainforests of New Guinea are the third-largest in the world. The island covers less than 1% of the planet’s land area but contains at least 5% of its species, many of which are only found there. These include kangaroos adapted to climb trees, giant pigeons, and more species of orchid than anywhere else on Earth. While much of New Guinea’s forests are still intact, the expanding production of crops like cocoa, coffee, and palm oil could drive the loss of 17 million acres of forest by 2030.

To prevent unsustainable agricultural practices and to combat illegal logging, WWF collaborates with indigenous peoples in New Guinea and helps companies achieve FSC certification, ensuring that forests are managed responsibly and that important habitats are conserved for future generations.

### %SEVEN UNSUNG ECOSYSTEMS WE NEED TO SURVIVE: Forests of eastern Australia

Though Australia is mostly desert, the tropical and temperate forests, savannas, and shrublands along the country’s eastern coast are some of the most biologically diverse regions on Earth, with thousands of plant species and more than 150 species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds found nowhere else.

Unfortunately, the continent’s forests are now being cleared at a rapid pace for livestock and agriculture, making it one of the world’s most at-risk deforestation fronts. But that’s not just bad news for trees. When trees and other vegetation are removed, sediment, fertilizer, and pesticides run off into the nearby Great Barrier Reef, where they smother coral reefs and pollute fragile marine ecosystems. Land-clearing also drives climate change, leading to rising ocean temperatures and coral bleaching.

In Australia, WWF is working to increase native forest cover and protect threatened species by advocating for stronger laws against excessive land-clearing, in addition to championing grater protections for the Great Barrier Reef.

### %SEVEN UNSUNG ECOSYSTEMS WE NEED TO SURVIVE: Northern Great Plains

Two hundred years ago, as many as 60 million bison roamed America’s plains—along with pronghorn, black-footed ferrets, swift foxes, and a vast array of birds. As pioneers moved west in the 19th and early 20th centuries, however, hundreds of millions of acres of the country’s natural grasslands were converted for cropland, infrastructure, and living space.

Today, this landscape continues to lose ground. In recent years, the Northern Great Plains have lost more natural habitat than the Brazilian Amazon, emitting greenhouse gases equivalent to more than 100 million cars on the road each year. To keep this fragile prairie ecoregion intact, WWF works hand-in-hand with ranchers, farmers, and tribal nations to encourage sustainable land management, restore native species, and to protect the region’s natural and cultural heritage.

## %The world’s rarest big cat grows in number

Inside Russia’s Land of the Leopard National Park, more than 400 cameras are positioned to capture images of wildlife, specifically the critically endangered Amur Leopard. These cameras are the main source of monitoring data for the Amur leopard and their latest reveal is one to celebrate.

Recent images documented 84 adult cats and 19 cubs inside the park. This is a significant increase since a 2000 census recorded just 30 cats, and a 2015 survey numbered only 70.

The Land of the Leopard National Park is the core area for the rare wild cat. Formally established in 2012, the park is home to the majority of the Amur leopard’s known territory and provides the cat sufficient prey and protection from poachers. It is also home to a population of Amur tigers and other wildlife.

Camera trap monitoring is the main research method used to study Amur leopards in the wild, and individuals are identified by their unique spot patterns. With around 400 cameras monitoring wildlife in the park, it is the largest camera trap network in Russia. Scientists processed the collected data over several months before announcing the new population numbers. WWF, along with partners WCS and the Far Eastern Leopard Centre, helped the park with camera trap monitoring and data processing.

"Our forecasts were optimistic, and since the establishment of the Land of the Leopard National Park in 2012, the number of the rarest large cat has increased significantly,” said Sergey Donskoy, the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment of Russia.

Experts believe more leopards may inhabit the territory outside the national park and are now working to collect more data from places like China where camera traps are already in place.

“Considering the Amur leopard is one of the most endangered large mammals in the world, this increase is such welcome news and reflects the importance of regular species monitoring to assess their health in the ecosystem,” said Nilanga Jayasinghe, Senior Program Officer, Asian Species

## %Tiger ranger, scientist, and detective

Temperatures drop well below -30C during winter months in the bitter wilderness of the Russian Far East. There, Pavel Fomenko will spend weeks out in the forest—up to 40 days in a row—often alone.

What brings Pavel out in such conditions and makes him stay? He is on the trail of the Amur tiger. Having spent more than 25 years working for WWF-Russia, Pavel knows these forests like the back of his hand and uses that knowledge to help protect the endangered Amur tiger, the biggest of the big cats.

It’s a lonely job being a tiger protector, and dangerous: “It's the risk of getting lost, the risk of getting frostbitten, the risk of encountering a predator,” says Pavel. “The cold is a very insidious phenomenon. It can be beautiful, but it is deadly. One must know how to survive in the cold and how to adapt.”

When out in the field he is on the lookout for signs of tigers, and for their only predators: poachers.

But Pavel’s work goes far beyond the forests. He is a ranger, a scientist and a detective. His ‘detective’ work out in the field—tracking tigers using scat and pug marks, and investigating poaching sites—translates into ‘CSI-style’ forensics work which he then carries out in laboratories.

Pavel is trained in a specialist form of wildlife forensics. Though wild tiger numbers have started to increase, the sad fact is that the remains of dead tigers are sometimes found in the field. When this happens, the animals are brought back to the Animal Diseases Diagnostics Centre in Ussurysk, where Pavel and his team carry out full forensic examinations.

The autopsies Pavel carries out on tigers aim to determine the cause of death, and ultimately decide whether the tiger died at the hands of humans or from natural causes.  

These examinations are essential in forming evidence for possible criminal cases in the illegal wildlife trade, and it’s a responsibility that he does not take lightly: “One must be completely honest… objective and professional. I am fully aware that, due to my expertise, a person will get a jail sentence or a large fine.”

Every year, the team carries out over 100 examinations on wild animals that are brought to the Diagnostics Centre. In the first half of 2016 alone, Pavel provided forensic and biological expertise for six criminal cases, three involving tigers.

Tiger protectors like Pavel are a key part of the efforts that have seen wild tiger numbers begin to rise globally for the first time in conservation history, after a long century of decline. Protecting tigers is Pavel’s passion, and he sees a more hopeful future for them.

“Tigers are powerful, they are beautiful, they are perfect… and they can coexist with humans.”

## %An Amur tiger returns to the wild

On April 29th, 2017, Filippa the Amur tiger was successfully released back into the wild. Less than a year and a half before, in December of 2015, the exhausted, starving, five-month-old tiger cub was found when she approached Filippovka village near Russia's Land of the Leopard National Park looking for food. Local people reported their find to the staff’s park, saving the tiger's life.

After 14 months at the Rehabilitation Center in the village of Alekseevka, Filippa—named after the village in which she was found—had fully recovered. She had learned to hunt by herself and was ready to be released. The successful release mission was performed with the support of WWF Russia and the Amur Tiger Center.

Amur tigers are endangered and have the largest home range of any tiger subspecies because they must search over large areas to find food due to low prey densities. By rehabilitating and releasing tigers like Filippa we can strengthen the Amur tiger population and continue to grow Amur tiger numbers.

WWF is on the frontlines working to protect Amur tigers and their forest habitats. We continue to work to monitor tiger populations, strengthen anti-poaching operations, protect habitats, increase tiger prey, raise awareness, and advocate for improved legislature so that the story of Amur tigers will be a successful one.

Filippa’s long journey to her new home went well. While sedated, she had a GPS collar attached to her neck.

The Amur Tiger Center provided the GPS collar to help the specialists monitor Filippa’s movements in the wild after her release.

Filippa was eager to break free, and quickly left her transportation cage, running away deep into the forest. She will hopefully easily settle in to her new home, and start breeding in the near future.

## %How fast are Amur leopards? And 9 other Amur leopard facts

The Amur leopard, also known as the Far East leopard, is the world’s rarest big cat. A subspecies of the leopard, these animals are found in the forested transboundary region that spans the Russian Far East and China. They are critically endangered, and WWF works with local communities, regional authorities, government and other non-governmental organizations to save the Amur leopard and ensure the long-term conservation of the region.

Take a look at some questions and answers about these majestic cats:

1. Where do Amur leopards live?
Amur leopards live in the Amur Heilong Landscape, which spans both the Russian Far East and adjacent areas of China. This rare subspecies of leopard has adapted to life in the temperate forests that make up the northernmost part of the species’ range.

2. How many Amur leopards are left in the wild?
In an amazing tale of recovery related to concerted conservation efforts, the number of Amur leopards in Russia has increased from 27-32 to 70-75 in the last 15 years, while China has recorded an increase of 13-15 individuals in bordering provinces.

3. How do Amur leopards differ from other leopards?
Amur leopards have a paler coat than most subspecies of leopards, and large, dark, widely spaced rosettes with thick, unbroken rings. They weigh 70-105 pounds. Since they are so well adapted to living in the harsh, cold climate of the Russian Far East, they have a thick coat that can grow as long as 7 centimeters in winter.

4. What threats do Amur leopards face?
The Amur leopards are poached largely for their beautiful, spotted fur. They also suffer from prey scarcity because the prey they feed on, such as roe deer, sika deer, and hare, are hunted by local communities for both food and income. They are also threatened by habitat loss.

5. How do Amur leopards raise their cubs?
Amur leopards have one to four cubs. They are weaned at the age of three months. Some males stay with females after mating and may even help with rearing the young. Cubs typically leave their mothers around the age of one and a half to two years. Often, siblings maintain contact during their early years of independence.

6. What are we doing to protect Amur leopards?
Amur leopards received a safe haven in 2012 when the Russian government declared a new protected area called Land of the Leopard National Park. The park is 650,000 acres and includes much of the Amur leopard’s breeding areas and about 60 percent of their remaining habitat. The park is also home to 10 endangered Amur tigers. WWF had lobbied for the establishment of this park since 2001. Conservationists are also working toward monitoring leopard populations as they disperse from the park into other parts of the region, as well as across the border and into neighboring Chinese nature reserves, and hope to establish a Sino-Russian transboundary nature reserve.

7. How fast are Amur leopards?
Similar to other leopards, the Amur leopard can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. This incredible animal has been reported to leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically.

8. Why do Amur leopards matter?
Amur leopards are important ecologically. They are top predators, meaning they play an important role in maintaining a healthy balance of species in their habitat. This influences the condition of the forest and ecosystem, which supplies wildlife and people with food, freshwater and many other resources. Conservation of Amur leopard habitat also benefits other species, including Amur tigers and prey species like deer.

9. What do Amur leopards sound like?
Leopards are silent most of the time, but sometimes they give hoarse, rasping coughs to advertise their presence or to announce territorial boundaries. Some leopards purr while feeding.

10. How do Amur leopards hunt?
Leopards are nimble-footed and strong. They carry and hide unfinished kills, often to higher branches on trees, so that their food is not taken by other predators. They are said to be the most accomplished stalkers and climbers of the big cats, and their immense strength allows them to tackle prey up to 10 times their own weight.
