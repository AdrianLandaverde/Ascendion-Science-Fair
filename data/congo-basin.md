# %CONGO BASIN

The Congo Basin makes up one of the most important wilderness areas left on Earth. At 500 million acres, it is larger than the state of Alaska and stands as the world’s second-largest tropical forest.

A mosaic of rivers, forests, savannas, swamps and flooded forests, the Congo Basin is teeming with life. Gorillas, elephants and buffalo all call the region home. The Congo Basin spans across six countries—Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.

There are approximately 10, 000 species of tropical plants in the Congo Basin and 30 percent are unique to the region. Endangered wildlife, including forest elephants, chimpanzees, bonobos, and lowland and mountain gorillas inhabit the lush forests. 400 other species of mammals, 1,000 species of birds and 700 species of fish can also be found here.

The Congo Basin has been inhabited by humans for more than 50,000 years and it provides food, fresh water and shelter to more than 75 million people. Nearly 150 distinct ethnic groups exist and the region’s Ba’Aka people are among the most well known representatives of an ancient hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Their lives and well-being are linked intimately with the forest.

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

Humans have inhabited the forests of the Congo Basin for tens of thousands of years. Today, the Congo Basin provides food, medicine, water, materials and shelter for over 75 million people. Among some 150 different ethnic groups, the Ba'Aka, BaKa, BaMbuti, Efe and other related groups—often referred to as Pygmies—are today's most visible representatives of an ancient hunter-gatherer lifestyle. They possess an incredible knowledge of the forest, its animals and its medicinal plants.

Most people in the Congo Basin remain heavily dependent on the forest for subsistence and raw materials, as a complement to agricultural activities. As populations rise, pressure on forests continues to increase. Forest edges of the forest-savanna mosaic bear the brunt of the population density, along with the banks of the larger navigable rivers, including the Congo and Ubangi Rivers.

Construction of roads has greatly facilitated access to the interior of the forest, and many people have relocated close to roads. But logging, oil palm plantations, population growth and road development have strained the traditional resource management system.

The Congo Basin covers some of the poorest countries on Earth. By focusing on the protection and sustainable use of natural resources, WWF seeks to ensure that the Congo Basin's forest and freshwater ecosystems will continue to be a major source of livelihood improvement for the region's people.

## %THREATS

The Congo Basin is abundant in natural resources such as timber, diamonds and petroleum, but current methods and rates of extracting these resources are unsustainable and threaten the future of this vast wilderness area. In addition, unsustainable hunting of wildlife for the commercial bushmeat market threatens to wipe out many species.

The main threats are:

- DEMAND FOR NATURAL RESOURCES
- ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE
- DEFORESTATION

### %THREATS: DEMAND FOR NATURAL RESOURCES

The Congo Basin is extremely rich in wood, oil and minerals such as diamonds, gold and coltan (used to make cell phones). Many people depend on such resources for their livelihoods, and the global demand for these materials is increasing.

A large and growing percentage of the Congo Basin is under concession to logging and mining companies. Such industries bring large groups of people to the forest and with that come their need for food, including bushmeat and fuelwood. Related infrastructure projects—such as roads and dams—have environmental impacts and increase access to remote forest areas for hunters.

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

The leading cause of wildlife loss in the Congo Basin is the commercial bushmeat trade, driven by an ever increasing market. In the DRC alone, over a million tons of bushmeat are consumed each year.

Alarmingly, this lucrative business is causing the forest to become empty of species. Animals like monkeys and antelope are common targets, although species such as gorillas and bonobos are also at risk.

Combating the bushmeat trade presents many challenges. In remote areas, bushmeat is the primary source of income for families, as it is the only export that will earn a profit. WWF works with communities to create alternatives.

The international demand for ivory still drives the killing of elephants, leading to local extinctions and threatening to eliminate elephants entirely. WWF plays an important role in fighting illegal trade, including through TRAFFIC, the world’s largest wildlife trade monitoring network.

### %THREATS: DEFORESTATION

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), refugees from armed conflict are forced to live off the land with severe impacts to forests and wildlife. For example, the demand for fuelwood and charcoal has led to deforestation in Virunga National Park, the oldest national park in Africa. Palm oil plantations and other commercial agriculture operations are a growing threat, putting greater pressure on the Congo’s forests and rivers.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

They are:

- SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATION ACROSS BORDERS
- CREATING SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES
- EMPOWERING LOCAL COMMUNITIES
- CURBING WILDLIFE TRADE

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATION ACROSS BORDERS

Ensuring protection of the Congo Basin requires a massive effort that reaches beyond political borders, especially when six countries have a direct stake. As part of the Congo Basin Forest Partnership, we collaborate with local governments and communities to sustainably manage the forests and protect wildlife.

We help create agreements between governments to allow for free movement of park staff across borders and joint patrols, bolstering antipoaching operations. Our partnerships also allow us to better address the needs of local communities that depend on the forests, empowering them to steward their resources and improve their livelihoods.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CREATING SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES

WWF works to ensure more sustainable methods of extracting natural resources, such as trees, oil, and minerals, with minimal impact to wildlife and forests. To reduce pressure for fuelwood, WWF has been part of a tree plantation program outside Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Over 10 million trees have been planted to help meet the needs of local people and preserve mountain gorilla habitat. WWF has also provided fuel-efficient stoves and works with communities to find alternative wood sources through private and community forests.

We also work toward Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in all critical forests throughout the Congo Basin. This certification ensures good forest management. So far, an area nearly as large as West Virginia has been independently certified by FSC in the Congo Basin.

To protect this important area, we are working to implement low-impact logging practices and leave some areas undisturbed. We also work to reduce the effects of iron-ore mines and stop poaching and bushmeat trade that may result from the influx of workers and roads.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: EMPOWERING LOCAL COMMUNITIES

Gorilla-based tourism helps raise funds to protect national parks and help local communities. Tourism fees generate much needed revenue for both the park and local communities. In the DRC, WWF introduced farmers to new types of crops and innovative methods to grow them so farming operations do not encroach upon nearby forest or harm wildlife. WWF has also worked to empower local women to improve their livelihoods and the nutrition of their children by encouraging their participation in the new farming program. WWF continues to empower local communities to conserve their resources and improve livelihoods.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CURBING WILDLIFE TRADE

Poaching continues to be a growing problem in the Congo Basin, even within national parks and other protected areas. The international trade in protected species such as elephants has reached levels which endanger the survival of these species. WWF recognizes the need for robust antipoaching operations. We also see the need to improve people’s standards of living in order to reduce their dependence on nature. WWF’s support and work with partners have enabled local authorities to increase antipoaching measures in the Congo Basin.

Mountain gorillas can only be found in two isolated regions in central Africa. Through the dedication of park staff, the number of mountain gorillas in Virungas National Park has increased, from an estimated population size of 380 to 480 in less than ten years. WWF plays an important role in fighting illegal trade through its partnership with TRAFFIC, the world’s largest wildlife trade monitoring network.

## %New study confirms FSC-certified forests help wildlife thrive in the Congo Basin

There’s good news for critically endangered species—including gorillas and elephants—in the Congo Basin. A new study reveals a higher number of large mammals in forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) in Gabon and the Republic of Congo, compared to non-FSC-certified forests. This news underscores the importance of FSC-certified forest concessions (areas where logging is sustainably managed) in protecting wildlife. The research, led by Utrecht University with support from WWF and the Wildlife Conservation Society, was published in Nature on April 10, 2024.

Key findings: FSC-certified forests a haven for larger mammals
By meticulously documenting individual animal counts and strategically positioning camera traps, the research affirmed that certified concessions notably harbor a bigger population of large and threatened mammals—2.7 times more for mammals over 220 pounds, such as gorillas and forest elephants. The conservation of these large mammals positively influences seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and forest carbon storage in the area. 

For mammals 66-220 pounds, such as leopards and chimpanzees, numbers rose to 2.5 times more animals in FSC-certified forest concessions. And for smaller mammals, numbers were similar between FSC- and non-FSC concessions.

The new study is the first to compare so many different forest areas at the same time, using 474 camera traps across 14 logging concessions (half of which were FSC-certified). The results align with previous research in the Peruvian Amazon, which found that it is possible to have production forestry coincide with biodiversity conservation if done in the right way and in the right places.

“It was a large and ambitious project that took five years and involved hundreds of local employees,” said Utrecht University’s Joeri Zwerts, who led the Congo Basin study. “It was hard work, but the knowledge we gained will make an important contribution to the protection of animals in tropical forests.”

Clear link between hunting and biodiversity loss
The research also details the impact of hunting on biodiversity loss, noting there were fewer signs of hunting and more observations of wildlife in FSC-certified concessions. Proactive measures by FSC-certified forestry companies, such as blocking old logging roads, establishing checkpoints, and supporting alternative protein sources for local communities, have significantly curbed illegal hunting.

Beyond wildlife conservation, the study highlights the broader positive impact of FSC certification. The conservation of large mammals positively influences seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and forest carbon storage. Previous research (published in Nature Geoscience) has shown that tropical forests would potentially store 7% less carbon without the presence of elephants.

“These results are inspiring and an indication that FSC continues to be an effective tool in tropical forests and that its standards translate into tangible impacts,” said Fran Price, leader, WWF Forest Practice. “Solutions that benefit both people and nature do exist, and responsible forest management certification is one of those vital solutions.”

Responsible forest management: An important pillar for biodiversity conservation
“FSC-certified forest concessions in the Congo Basin are often in large, remote areas, which are harvested under reduced-impact logging principles in a decades-long rotational pattern, meaning that large mammals are able to roam and avoid production areas,” said Jaap Van Der Waarde, WWF-Cameroon, who is a coauthor of the paper.

“This study’s findings provide convincing data that sustainable forestry practices can contribute to the conservation of wildlife whilst also supporting sustainable community and economic development,” said Tim Cronin, Forests Forward global lead, WWF. “To confirm that wildlife conservation need not come at the expense of economic development brings real hope for the future of the Congo Basin.”

As logging concessions account for more than half of the remaining forest areas in the two countries studied (61% in the Republic of Congo and 67% in Gabon), these positive results from FSC-certified concessions are of great significance for biodiversity in the region.

Making the right choices
WWF urges companies to pursue responsible forest management certified under FSC and invest more in research that can help inform the continual improvement of such mechanisms.

Through Forests Forward, WWF’s signature program for corporate action in support of nature, climate, and people, WWF works with several companies in the Congo Basin to improve forest management.

Consumer choice also plays an important role. As the paper’s lead author, Joeri Zwerts, said: “We, as consumers, affect ecosystems on the other side of the world, and we need to find ways to reduce our negative impact. Our research contributes to the knowledge that can help people to make the right choices.”

## %We're off track to protect and restore forests by 2030. Here's how we can change course.

A startling increase in the speed and intensity of global deforestation has derailed efforts to protect and restore forests by 2030, according to two new reports analyzing progress toward global forest conservation goals.

WWF's Forest Pathways 2023 report and the Forest Declaration Assessment detail the immense scale of forest loss just two years after more than 130 countries representing 85% of the planet's forests pledged to halt and reverse deforestation by the end of the decade. The lack of progress on commitments leaves the world in clear danger of missing vital targets.

In 2022, global deforestation reached 16.3 million acres, with primary tropical forest loss at 10.1 million acres. An alarming 96% of this takes place in tropical regions. Tropical Asia is the only region close to achieving zero deforestation. Without urgent action, tropical forests will begin to act as a carbon source, not a sink, under the pressures of a warming, drying, and increasingly extreme climate. Widespread and increasing deforestation and degradation in the planet's three largest tropical forest basins—the Amazon, Congo, and the forests of Asia-Pacific—could deliver a global climate catastrophe.

Fortunately, there's still time to halt deforestation and sustainably manage and restore forests in ways that benefit people and nature.

"If we're serious about ensuring a future for forests—and halting the biodiversity and climate crises—time is of the essence," said Kerry Cesareo, senior vice president for forests at WWF. "While the numbers are stark, we know what we need to do. And the Forest Pathways report provides tangible guidance for decision-makers, from governments to financial institutions to private sector actors."

Globally, at least 100 times more public funding goes to environmentally harmful subsidies than financing to help forests. Only $2.2 billion in public funds is channeled to forests each year—a mere fraction compared to other global investments. Indigenous peoples and local communities do not receive the necessary resources to secure their rights and effectively manage their lands, even though tropical forests under their stewardship are better protected and deforestation and degradation are lower.

In addition to calling for governments to meet their financial promises, the report sets out a blueprint to save forests by 2030, with essential measures, including:

- Ending forest-harming investments and subsidies such as agricultural subsidies responsible for the loss of 5.4 million acres of forest per year;
- Reforming the rules of global trade that harm forests, cutting deforesting commodities out of global supply chains, and removing barriers to forest-friendly goods;
- Accelerating the recognition of land rights to Indigenous peoples;
- And making the shift toward nature-based economies.

Forest Pathways also includes specific case studies detailing efforts underway across the globe to confront deforestation. These include the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program in Brazil and WWF's signature corporate engagement program for forests, Forests Forward.

WWF urges governments and businesses to heed the warnings from the new data and take urgent action to protect and restore forests, including supporting the passage of the FOREST Act and enforcement of the Lacey Act in the United States. 

Forests are at the heart of WWF's work. We've supported the creation of protected areas, helped move the forest sector toward sustainability and transparency, and galvanized momentum around forest landscape restoration. We're also working alongside local and global partners to halt deforestation, help restore forests, and put deforestation-free commitments into action around the world.

## %A baby gorilla and multiple elephant calves make their debut in Dzanga-Sangha

Life recently sprang anew amid the lush forest of the Central African Republic. A baby gorilla and a slew of newborn African forest elephants were spotted in the Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas complex—a biodiversity hotspot that’s home to an incredible range of wildlife from bongos to forest buffalo.

The gorilla is named Moandja, after the area of closed canopy with no undergrowth where trackers observed her for the first time. She is the youngest of three offspring of the female Mapoki. The group, led by the silverback Mayele, now stands at 10 individuals.

Meanwhile, experts spotted a large presence of elephant calves under the age of one in the Dzanga bai, the most impressive among the many unique forest clearings in the Congo Basin that forest elephants frequent in search of mineral-rich mud and to socialize. The babies submerged in water, rolled in mud, and nuzzled their mothers.

These sightings—both the gorilla and elephants—show the importance of well-managed protected areas to the long-term survival of wildlife. Forest elephants are experiencing a population collapse throughout central Africa, so these births are of particular importance to their conservation. WWF has co-managed Dzanga-Sangha with the Central African Republic government since 1989, undertaking research on elephant movement using satellite collars, supporting research in the area, and habituating gorillas, among other crucial activities.

As well as being rich with biodiversity, the Dzanga-Sangha is also a culturally diverse area, home to nearly 150 distinct ethnic groups including the Ba’Aka people. It’s also a model for holistic and inclusive conservation where WWF works with the government, Ba’Aka people, and other community stakeholders to protect wildlife in this area, while also supporting and improving the livelihoods of Indigenous peoples and local communities.

Ecotourism serves as an important source of income, so these recent sightings of elephant calves and a newborn gorilla provide hopeful signs of healthy wildlife populations that will support this important livelihood.

## %Eight species making a comeback

Species recovery is an essential part of any ecosystem's long-term resiliency and health. And there are some key species making a comeback and playing a pivotal role in their ecosystems.

Sumatra’s Thirty Hills is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth, where WWF has been focusing ecosystem restoration efforts for the past few years. A recent biodiversity monitoring survey in the region revealed many iconic species from tigers to Sumatran elephants, Sunda pangolins, Malayan tapirs, Sunda clouded leopards, and more, all of which are benefiting from conservation efforts.

Recovering species is essential for effective wildlife conservation and critical to the work WWF does around the world. Here are just a few of our favorite, recent recovery stories:

- Black-footed ferrets in the Northern Great Plains
- Black rhinos in Namibia
- Greater one-horned rhino in India
- Humpback whales in oceans
- Mountain gorillas in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo
- Snow leopards in Mongolia
- Swift foxes in Montana
- Tigers in Nepal

### %Eight species making a comeback: Black-footed ferrets in the Northern Great Plains

For the last 30 years, concerted efforts from many organizations have given black-footed ferrets
—one of North America’s most endangered mammals—a second chance for survival. Declines in the habitat of prairie dogs, the main prey species for black-footed ferrets, and non-native disease led to their extinction. Today, recovery efforts have helped restore black-footed ferrets to around 300 animals across North America; the goal is to reach 3,000. Their recovery in the wild signifies the health of the grassland ecosystem which they depend on to survive.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Black rhinos in Namibia

In March 2020, the southwestern black rhino, one of three black rhino subspecies, was reclassified from “vulnerable” to “near-threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) after its population increased more than 11%. This status change parallels a hopeful trend for all of Africa’s black rhinos. Although the species overall faces persistent threats from poaching and is still classified as critically endangered, its population has climbed steadily since 2012.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Greater one-horned rhino in India

In 2020, Manas National Park, located in the northeastern Indian state of Assam, saw a significant growth in its greater one-horned rhino population. Thanks to conservation efforts, such as rhino translocations, Manas is now home to 47 greater one-horned rhinos!

### %Eight species making a comeback: Humpback whales in oceans 

After significant efforts to reduce present-day threats of fisheries bycatch and ship collisions with wildlife, humpback whales have been on a steady road to recovery in several of the world’s oceans. In Australia alone, data shows that both east and west coast populations have been rapidly recovering and are now 50% larger than their pre-whaling numbers.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Mountain gorillas in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo

Recent research revealed that an increasing number of mountain gorillas—a species once thought to be extinct by the end of the 20th century—now reside in a large swathe of protected forest in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The 83,840-acre Bwindi-Sarambwe ecosystem that runs from Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, through the Sarambwe Nature Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo, is one of two places on Earth where mountain gorillas still exist with a population of 459 individuals, up from an estimated 400 in 2011.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Snow leopards in Mongolia

Mongolia’s first-ever national snow leopard survey in 2021 showed that the country’s snow leopard population is stable with approximately 953 individuals—an exciting discovery that indicates current conservation efforts are working to protect this charismatic and elusive big cat.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Swift foxes in Montana

In 2020, after a 51-year absence, swift foxes returned to the grasslands of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, joining other prairie wildlife found within these Native nation-owned lands. Twenty-seven swift foxes were brought to the area from Wyoming in September, marking the beginning of a five-year reintroduction program led by the Nakoda and Aaniiih Nations of Fort Belknap. One litter of kits was documented, and an additional 48 swift foxes were released in 2021, both of which are helping to establish a sustainable population on the Reservation.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Tigers in Nepal

In 2018, Nepal announced that the country’s tiger population estimate had increased to 235, nearly doubling a 2009 baseline of just 121 individual tigers. Nepal is on track to become one of the first countries to double its country’s wild tiger numbers since the ambitious TX2 goal – to double the world’s wild tiger population.
