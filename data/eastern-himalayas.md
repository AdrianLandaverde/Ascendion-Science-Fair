# %EASTERN HIMALAYAS

This enchanted Shangri-La stretches across Nepal, Bhutan, northeast India, southeast Tibet and northern Myanmar. The region is home to iconic species such as the snow leopard, Bengal tiger and one-horned rhino, as well as millions of people.

The Himalayas is the highest mountain range in the world, and has 9 out of 10 of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest. These mountains, referred to as the Third Pole, are the source of some of Asia’s major rivers and also help to regulate our planet’s climate. For centuries people here have developed a unique culture that weaves nature and people together into the same fabric of life. The region is the birthplace of the Buddha, and is full of sacred natural sites such as secret valleys and high mountain lakes that predate ancient Hinduism.

The Himalayas face many challenges, and governments are under pressure to provide for their people and secure their natural heritage. Forests are strained as demand continues to grow for timber and food crops. Protected areas are becoming isolated pockets, and international criminal networks are emptying forests of rare wildlife to feed the voracious illegal market. The impact of global climate change is melting the once mighty Himalayas at a rate faster than ever recorded in human history, jeopardizing a vital source of freshwater for billions of people in Asia.

WWF has worked in the region since the start of the conservation movement and the founding of our organization in 1961. By joining hands with governments, local communities and supporters around the world, we have made progress for wild species and natural landscapes. But more needs to be done to forge a sustainable future for the Eastern Himalayas.

CONTINENT: Asia
SPECIES: Asian elephant, Snow leopard, Ganges River dolphin, Red panda, Continental tiger, Greater one-horned rhino

## %SPECIES

The Eastern Himalayas harbor an amazing diversity of life. There are 163 globally threatened species found in the Himalayas, including Asia’s three largest herbivores – Asian elephant, greater one-horned rhinoceros and wild water buffalo – and its largest carnivore, the tiger. The region is home to:

• 10,000 types of plants
• 300 mammals
• 977 birds
• 176 reptiles
• 105 amphibians
• 269 freshwater fish

The Himalayan grasslands have the densest population of Bengal tigers, which live alongside Asian elephants and one-horned rhinos. The mountains offer refuge for red pandas, golden langurs and takins. This is the only known location in the world where Bengal tigers and snow leopards share habitat.

The main species are:

- SNOW LEOPARD
- RED PANDA
- GANGES RIVER DOLPHIN
- ASIAN ELEPHANT
- RHINO
- GREATER ONE-HORNED RHINO

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

WWF works closely with communities across the Eastern Himalayas because they are the true stewards of nature. Local ownership, alternative sources of income, women's empowerment, and long-term sustainable livelihoods are all elements of our work.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: CULTURE OF CONSERVATION

The breadth of natural biodiversity in the Eastern Himalayas is complemented by a rich mosaic of cultures, traditions and people. Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and animists have lived closely with nature for centuries and have created a culture of conservation. Ancient traditions and livelihoods of many communities remain woven into the balanced use of natural resources. They depend on these resources for their livelihoods, and value ecosystem services such as freshwater, erosion control, and agricultural and subsistence harvests. The people ensure that their traditional activities are sustainable by practicing small-scale agriculture and effective community management.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: ADAPTING TO A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT

The region faces serious threats from poverty and an increasing population. Almost half of India’s immense population lives within 310 miles of the Himalayan range along the Gangetic plains. The need for food, shelter and industries to support modern lifestyles is exerting tremendous pressure on nature. Localized cutting and clearing of wood for agriculture is depleting large areas of forest and stripping steep slopes of trees. Intensive livestock grazing damages sensitive alpine meadows. Climate change is melting the mighty mountain glaciers, which jeopardizes the source of freshwater for more than 700 million people in the region.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: POWER FOR THE PEOPLE

WWF celebrated a major milestone in 2006 when the government of Nepal handed over the management of Kangchenjunga Conservation Area to the local communities. This historic action was an important landmark in the Eastern Himalayas. It demonstrated the government’s commitment to the delegation of power to local communities. This victory was led by WWF’s conservation heroes Mingma Norbu Sherpa and Dr. Chandra Gurung, who both passed away in a tragic accident on their way back from Kangchenjunga. This continues to be a model for community-led conservation. There is less pressure on local forests and people have a positive attitude toward wildlife conservation. Wildlife poaching and illegal harvesting of valuable medicinal plants have decreased. The people actively monitor wildlife and stop illegal activities.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- HABITAT LOSS
- HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT
- CLIMATE CHANGE
- ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

### %THREATS: HABITAT LOSS

The conversion of forests for agriculture and exploitation for timber, fodder and fuelwood threaten the biodiversity in this region. Charcoal production in low elevation areas and intensive grazing at higher elevations also threatens forests. The need for firewood is not only a burden for nature, but also for people. Women usually spend hours in the forest looking for firewood, which increases their chances for conflict with wildlife. Many rural people depend on cattle for their livelihoods but do not have sufficient land for grazing. It is common to see cows, water buffalo and goats grazing in forests. Forests can sustain a small amount of grazers, but current numbers are unsustainable. Grazers often eat saplings and destroy future forest regeneration.

### %THREATS: HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT

The frequency of human-wildlife conflict increases as human populations grow and more land is cleared. Levels of conflict heighten and tolerance decreases when traditional practices are interrupted. WWF and other conservation organizations work to eliminate human-wildlife conflicts. For example, a community-managed livestock insurance plan compensates villagers for livestock losses from snow leopards. As these conservation measures take root, snow leopard numbers are on the rise.

### %THREATS: CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate change is impacting people and threatening wildlife in the Eastern Himalayas. Many glaciers are melting and forming lakes prone to bursting and downstream flooding. Traditional water springs have dried up, limiting the water supply. Farmers’ crops suffer from changing patterns of rainfall, which threatens the food security of the local people. Warmer temperatures and changing humidity have brought insect pests and disease to areas where they were previously absent.

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

In addition to deforestation and other habitat loss, poaching is the main threat to wildlife in the region. Tigers and rhinos are the most at risk because of their high commercial value in the black market. Smaller animals such as deer are sometimes poached for meat, and fish are frequently poached in protected areas. Poachers use nets and poison that can contaminate whole rivers. There are approximately 15 transboundary hotspots for wildlife trafficking between Nepal and China’s Tibet Autonomous Region.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

WWF helps to protect, restore and reconnect natural landscapes across the Eastern Himalayas. Our goal is to make sure plant and animal species can thrive and at the same time local communities are able to maintain and improve their livelihoods. This includes the sustainable use of natural resources from forests, grasslands and freshwater systems. We work with the governments of Bhutan, India and Nepal, as well as local communities, to protect forests, animal habitats and freshwater sources. We also work to empower communities to protect sacred lands.

They are:

- RESTORING THE TERAI ARC LANDSCAPE
- SAFEGUARDING BHUTAN’S NATURAL LANDSCAPE
- PRESERVING THE SACRED HIMALAYAN LANDSCAPE
- CONSERVING THE TIBETAN PLATEAU’S VITAL ECOSYSTEM
- PROTECTING NORTHEAST INDIA’S FORESTS
- 20 YEARS IN NEPAL

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: RESTORING THE TERAI ARC LANDSCAPE

 Nepal’s Terai Arc region is home to endangered rhinos and elephants, and the world’s highest concentration of tigers. WWF is connecting 11 protected areas by restoring the forests between them, which provides habitat corridors needed for species survival. We also empower local communities and improve livelihoods by establishing community forestry groups that enable communities to benefit from forests by managing and restoring them.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: SAFEGUARDING BHUTAN’S NATURAL LANDSCAPE

More than 70 percent of Bhutan’s land is covered by intact forests. Bhutan has an ambitious plan to maintain almost 400,000 acres of ‘wildlife highways’ that connect protected areas across the country. As the only international conservation organization with a permanent presence in Bhutan, WWF collaborates with the royal government to address Bhutan’s economic and environmental needs. We also engage and raise the technical capacity of the local people through education.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PRESERVING THE SACRED HIMALAYAN LANDSCAPE

The Himalayas are an important source of fresh water for millions of people in South Asia. Its alpine meadows and conifer forests harbor an array of rare plant life and endangered species. WWF’s Sacred Himalayan Landscape taps into the spiritual beliefs and conservation ethics of local communities to restore essential habitats and protect endangered species such as the snow leopard. We help local communities and local governments manage their forests, streams, soils and wildlife more sustainably. We also directly improve people’s lives through activities such as the establishment of women’s groups that focus on literacy and sustainable income generation skills.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CONSERVING THE TIBETAN PLATEAU’S VITAL ECOSYSTEM

The Tibetan Plateau is a deceptively fragile ecosystem of immense biological and cultural importance. This high altitude Serengeti is home to the snow leopard, red panda and vast herds of wild yak, gazelle and antelope. The glaciers and wetlands of Tibet are the source of many of Asia’s most important rivers, including the Yangtze, Mekong and Brahmaputra, all of which ensure fresh water to nearly half of humanity. These rivers and glaciers are now imperiled by climate change. WWF focuses on implementation of adaptation strategies aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of these river source areas.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING NORTHEAST INDIA’S FORESTS

Old-growth forests extend from Bhutan into northeast India, where a growing population and infrastructure projects threaten some of the largest and last intact forests in Asia. WWF applies its experiences from community-based conservation in the Terai Arc and Bhutan to protect the forests of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, restore critical elephant habitats, and reduce incidents of human-elephant conflict.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: 20 YEARS IN NEPAL

Three people in a small room—that was the start of WWF’s office in Nepal in 1993 even though we had been supporting conservation efforts in the country from the 1960s. Two decades later, we have a nearly 100 staff and work that extends to the government, conservation agencies and local communities. WWF has been part of many significant advances in conservation, all of which have been possible because of the power of partnerships.

Conservation gains in Nepal include the success of landscape level conservation such as the ambitious Terai Arc, Sacred Himalayan landscape programs led by the government with support from WWF, and community-based conservation efforts whereby local communities now lead and support nature conservation.

## %India completes its first-ever snow leopard population survey

Snow leopards live high in the Himalayas—one of the least forgiving environments and among the most challenging places to study— making our critical efforts to assess their population incredibly difficult. Fortunately, skilled scientists in India completed the first-ever rigorous examination of the country’s snow leopard population, estimating that 718 of these iconic big cats live within the country’s borders.

Findings in the Snow Leopard Population Assessment will contribute to understanding snow leopard ecology and the importance of their high-altitude habits. India joins Bhutan and Mongolia as one of the first countries to establish their snow leopard population. India’s large-scale assessment was highly intensive and required surveying over 10 million acres of the habitat and deploying about 2,000 camera traps that produced thousands of photos.

“India's study marks a leap forward, not just for the 718 majestic cats counted, but for conservation itself," said Dechen Dorji, senior director for Asia, Wildlife Conservation. "This landmark effort, spanning vast and rugged Himalayan terrain, provides crucial data to guide their protection. It's a triumph of collaboration, perseverance, and scientific rigor, offering immense hope for safeguarding this elusive protector of the High Himalayas. It marks an important milestone in our collective efforts to ensure their survival and that their landscapes thrive for generations to come.” 

WWF-US collaborates closely with WWF-India and supports the capacity to research and survey some of the key landscapes vital for the snow leopard. The report underscores the Himalayas' critical role as a refuge for snow leopards and emphasizes the importance of international collaboration like the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program.

## %Bhutan’s snow leopard population increases by almost 40% in only six years

Bhutan’s snow leopard population increased by 39.5% since 2016, according to a new survey implemented by the Royal Government of Bhutan’s Department of Forests and Park Services with support from WWF-Bhutan and partners. Findings from over 10,000 camera trap images confirmed the presence of 134 snow leopards in the country, an impressive jump from the baseline of 96 snow leopards in 2016.

The nation’s National Snow Leopard Survey 2022-2023 shows promising evidence that Bhutan’s conservation efforts positively impact snow leopard populations and that their habitat in the alpine mountain ecosystem is healthy. The survey involved 310 camera traps across 2.2 million acres of the big cat’s range.

“With less than 3% of the range surveyed, there are serious knowledge gaps in the population status of snow leopards,” said Dechen Dorji, Senior Director of Asia Wildlife Conservation, WWF-US. “A 39.5% increase in Bhutan’s snow leopard population is remarkable and calls for the urgent need to scale the population assessment efforts across the range. These magnificent creatures deserve our continued vigilance and protection from poaching, habitat destruction, and conflict with people. Finding effective co-existence measures, between local communities and snow leopards, and mobilizing resources at scale must continue to be our top priorities.”

Although the news confirms Bhutan as a snow leopard stronghold and source population for neighboring range countries, the species is still listed as ‘vulnerable’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is globally threatened by habitat degradation, prey depletion, conflicts with humans, and the climate crisis. Snow leopards need continued protection and interventions to address these threats, which also affect the other wildlife in their habitat.

## %WWF’s Dechen Dorji on keeping the spirit of the Year of the Tiger close to our hearts

Growing up in Bhutan, I often heard the many myths and legends of a fierce and powerful creature that stalked the forests of my home country—the tiger. Its orange and black coat created a striking contrast against the green hues of its surroundings. I was captivated by the stories my elders and teachers would tell me about the elegant ferocity and commanding, elusive presence of this animal—and how rare it was to see one, making it the stuff of legends.

Before I even knew that I wanted to devote myself to wildlife conservation when I grew up, I had tremendous respect for the awe-inspiring tiger—or Taag as they are called in Dzongkha, my native language. They’re embedded in my culture. It is said that Padmasambhava, a legendary Buddhist master often referred to as “The Second Buddha,” flew on the back of a tigress to meditate in the clifftops of Bhutan in an area where Paro Taktsang, or “Tiger’s Nest,” monastery now sits. I still remember that wide-eyed child who was utterly captivated and enthralled by the grandeur of these creatures. And as I grew, I carried that inspiration with me as I discovered my passion for conservation, becoming the active voice for the animals I read about in my childhood stories.

Last year, the world celebrated the official Year of the Tiger in the Lunar calendar—a year that held significance for many people around the world, particularly in East Asia, because tigers embody the values of courage, respect, and resilience. I knew the Year of the Tiger offered a message of hope and triumph over obstacles and reminded us of our primal connection to nature. As a conservationist, I had seen this year as a moment for celebration and renewed commitments to their protection and recovery of tigers in the wild. Tigers have been facing unprecedented threats for many years, but conservation efforts over the past decade have shown that recovering tigers from the brink of extinction is possible when we transcend boundaries and work together. I have witnessed how Bhutan’s cultural reverence and love for wildlife and nature have shaped the country’s conservation efforts. Bhutan has designated 52% of the country’s total area as protected lands, all prime habitat for tigers and their prey.

In my culture, tigers are not regarded as biological specimens, but instead as spiritual entities and symbols. Tiger is one of the four auspicious creatures (Taag, Seng, Chung, Druk) and the only real one. The other three are mythical—the garuda, snow lion, and dragon. It is believed that these four sacred creatures represent qualities and attitudes that Bodhisattvas—Buddhists on the path to enlightenment—cultivate on their way.

Tigers have been threaded into stories, religion, and ways of life for centuries. And they are intricately connected to nature’s web of life. Tigers are instrumental in maintaining the healthy forests, rivers, and streams we all depend upon. And they continue to be our teachers and spiritual guides, showing us just how connected we are to each other and the environment around us. That primal connection to nature—through our history, culture, and experiences—can be very powerful in inspiring us to take action and informing the conservation decisions we make. In Bhutan, culture has always been an integral part of the country’s conservation work, and our development philosophy of gross national happiness, or, simply put, our development with values.

Tigers need our help, now more than ever. And so, even though we’ve left the Year of the Tiger, my wish going forward is that we harness the symbolic qualities and teachings of the tiger and hold on to that spirit of tenacity, partnership, and perseverance to protect and give back to nature and its bountiful offerings, using what it has taught and how it has inspired us.

Despite my many years of working in conservation, I have yet to have the great luck of seeing a tiger in all its glory in the wild, though the child in me continues to dream that I will someday soon. But for that to happen, I ask that we all promise to make each coming year a better one for tigers and the vision they represent, ensuring that they stay forever wild and thriving and not just the stuff of paintings or statues adorning a temple wall, joining the other three mythical animals. 

## %How scientists count tigers in India

From dense jungles to the Himalayas, tigers are an elusive species—hard to find and hard to count. But, thanks to the use of camera traps, the movements, and behaviors of tigers are now less of a mystery.

Tracking tigers through camera traps has fast become the standard method for countries to count their tigers, and India is currently using this important tool. India is home to over 60% of the world’s tiger population which makes its counting efforts the world’s largest camera-trapping exercise.

### %How scientists count tigers in India: How are camera traps used to count tigers?

Camera trapping has evolved from earlier methods of counting tigers by using their footprints—or pugmarks—which provided inaccurate population estimates.

Before setting the camera traps, teams survey an area for the presence of tigers and other wildlife. This helps them to identify promising locations to set up camera traps.

Teams then head out to these pre-identified locations that are often remote and difficult to access. The cameras are loaded with a memory card and batteries and then attached to a tree or post where they will be left for two to three months before being retrieved. They have an infrared beam and will start recording photos and/or video when a tiger—or other wildlife—passes in front of it, breaking the beam.

After the team retrieves the memory cards, they analyze the data. It’s not uncommon to get thousands of photos and videos to sift through!

The cameras are set up in pairs to capture both sides of the tiger to see all of its stripes. A tiger’s stripe pattern is like a human fingerprint—unique to the individual. This helps experts to identify and count the tigers in an area and ensure they aren’t counting the same tiger twice.

### %How scientists count tigers in India: Why is India counting its tigers?

Estimating an area’s tiger population informs the conservation measures WWF-India takes in partnership with local communities and the State Forest Department. The Indian government conducts the All-India Tiger Estimation every four years to determine the number of tigers roaming its forests. These surveys are critical for tracking tiger population trends, documenting encouraging stories of success, and highlighting areas of concern where populations are declining.

Two thousand twenty-two is the Year of the Tiger and the 12-year anniversary of the first Global Tiger Summit in 2010 during which tiger range governments made an ambitious goal to double the number of tigers in the wild. In September of this year, Russia will host the second Global Tiger Summit at which a new tiger population estimate will be released.

India, like all other tiger range countries, is counting its tigers to provide an updated population estimate, which will be released by the Summit in Russia this year.

## %Two snow leopards successfully collared in Nepal

Scientists successfully collared two snow leopards in Western Nepal—a feat that will help researchers learn more about this elusive and vulnerable species. The satellite GPS collaring of these big cats brings Nepal’s tally of collared snow leopards to eight. The two adult males—a 7-year-old and a 6-year-old—are in sound health and moving through their normal range area after being fitted with collars in Shey Phoksundo National Park.

A team of 30 members comprised of staff from the Shey Phoksundo National Park Office, wildlife experts, technicians, veterinarians from WWF Nepal and the National Trust for Nature Conservation, and local citizen scientists participated in this year’s expedition.

National park staff and conservation biologists will closely monitor the big cats over the next 18 months. The GPS collars periodically transmit the location of the animals, providing invaluable information on the snow leopard’s habitat, spatial behavior, and movement across borders. This data helps inform conservation planning for the species.

“With less than 3% of Snow Leopard Range surveyed so far, the advancement in safe wildlife collaring technology provides the much-needed tool to understand their distribution, population dynamics and the likely impacts of climate change,” said Dechen Dorji, senior director for Asia, Wildlife Conservation, at WWF. “Nepal is once again leading and pushing the boundaries in this field.”

Scientists collared the first four snow leopards in Kanchenjunga Conservation Area between 2012 and 2017. This is the second satellite telemetry expedition undertaken in Shey Phoksundo National Park. The first was conducted in 2019 during which scientists successfully collared two male snow leopards.

“The science derived from collaring expeditions such these are critical in strengthening conservation and management in the Western Himalayan Snow Leopard Landscape, a region known to have the highest snow leopard density in Nepal,” said Dr. Pem Narayan Kandel, secretary, Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment.

## %More than 70% of snow leopard habitat remains unexplored

Snow leopards live in some of the most rugged landscapes in Asia’s high mountains, which makes it incredibly difficult to study these rare and elusive big cats. A large majority of snow leopard habitat remains under-researched, according to the first-ever systematic review of snow leopard research conducted to date.

WWF’s Over 100 Years of Snow Leopard Research examines the current state of knowledge across the 12 countries within this iconic species’ range by reviewing peer-reviewed published papers on the species and its habitat. The report highlights some glaring gaps in our knowledge of this elusive and threatened big cat and reveals that lack of basic data could be hampering their conservation.

“We have very little understanding of the human side of conservation," said Rishi Kumar Sharma, WWF’s global snow leopard leader and lead author of the report. "Ecological research around snow leopards has grown, but we need to also include and better understand the local communities that share space with snow leopards and who can greatly contribute to conservation interventions.” 

Despite a major research focus on snow leopard population assessments, less than 3% of the big cat’s range has robust data on snow leopard abundance. Though snow leopard research has been growing exponentially in the past few decades, the review found only four research hotspots, where multi-year research is being carried out. All research efforts, spanning over a century, covered only 23% of the snow leopard habitat. A majority of this range—possibly over 420 million acres of rugged mountain terrain—has never been researched from a snow leopard context.

Globally, there could be as few as 4,000 snow leopards and the remaining population faces traditional and emerging threats. Increased habitat loss and degradation, poaching, and conflict with communities have contributed to a decline in their numbers and left the species hanging by a thread in many places. Though conservationists are addressing such threats, a robust analysis of how effective the interventions are in achieving their objectives remains scarce.

“By identifying gaps in research, the report presents a valuable opportunity to assess and prioritize snow leopard research,” said Nilanga Jayasinghe, manager, Asian species conservation at WWF. “Improved knowledge can provide opportunities for data-driven and targeted conservation actions that will not only help snow leopards but the other wildlife and communities that share their space.”

As part of its conservation strategy, WWF supports vital research including the use of camera traps and satellite collaring to collect more data on the elusive big cat. In recent years, there has been a growing global focus on national-level population assessments, and several range countries and non-governmental organizations have come up with nationwide snow leopard numbers. Bhutan was the first country to conduct a snow leopard population survey in 2016, followed by Russia, and now Mongolia this year.
