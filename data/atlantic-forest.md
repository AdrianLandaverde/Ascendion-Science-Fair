# %ATLANTIC FOREST

The Atlantic Forest stretches from northeast Brazil southward along the Atlantic coastline and inland into northeast Argentina and eastern Paraguay. It is a complex comprising 15 ecoregions, including tropical and subtropical rain forest, coastal forest, mangroves, and Araucaria moist forest.

Having evolved prior to and in isolation from the Amazon, its ecosystems are unique and have a high degree of endemism (i.e., species found nowhere else on the planet). It ranks among the world's top global biodiversity hot spots, housing one in 14 of the Earth’s total plant species and one in 20 of its vertebrate species.

The Atlantic Forest plays an important role in mitigating climate change. One hectare of forest in the Upper Paraná ecoregion can store an average of 223.5 tons of carbon; in the Serra do Mar ecoregion, the carbon stock per hectare is estimated between 320 and 460 tons, depending on elevation.

Once covering over 350 million acres, human activity has destroyed 88% of the original vegetation in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, making it one of the most endangered biomes in the world. Remaining tracts are highly fragmented; in the Upper Paraná for instance, 70% of these are under 250 acres in size.

## %SPECIES

Although only a fragment of the original biome remains, the Atlantic Forest is second only to the Amazon in biodiversity in the Americas. The density of biodiversity there is staggering, with 443 tree species identified in a single hectare. Remaining forest fragments provide refuge to endangered species, including jaguars, golden lion tamarins, woolly spider monkeys, maned three-toed sloths, and red-tailed parrots. New species continue to be found in this rich forest complex despite its current state. Since 1990, more than 30 mammal species, nine bird species, and about 100 species of frogs have been discovered there.

The Atlantic Forest contains remarkable biodiversity:

- 20,000 species of plants (40% endemic)
- More than 2,000 vertebrate species (30% endemic)
- 298 mammal species (90 of these are endemic); these include 24 species of monkeys, 80% of which are endemic
- 1,023 bird species (around 200 of these are endemic)
- 475 amphibian species (286 of these are endemic)
- 306 reptiles (94 of these are endemic)

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

The Atlantic Forest is home to around 150 million people—about a third of South America’s population. Two of the world’s largest cities—Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo—are located in the Atlantic Forest. Seventy percent of Brazil’s gross domestic product is generated in this region, and it is the source of drinking water for a significant portion of the country’s population. Hydropower generated in the Atlantic Forest provides 62%, 75%, and 60% of Brazil’s, Paraguay’s, and Argentina’s electricity, respectively.

## %THREATS

Very little of the Atlantic Forest remains, and what does is highly fragmented, posing serious threats to the resident wildlife. Many important commodities sold into domestic and international markets are produced in this region, including soy, beef, pulp and paper, sugarcane, corn, and cotton. Expansion of agriculture and pastures is the largest driver of continued deforestation, and infrastructure development, illegal hunting, and unsustainable harvesting contribute to degradation and loss of forest.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

Restoring the Atlantic Forest ecosystem is critical for safeguarding the water supply of Brazil and the broader region; enhancing the resilience of plant, animal, and human communities to climate change; and sequestering atmospheric carbon.

Thanks to coordination and support from conservation organizations, the private sector, local communities, and governments, we’re not losing the forest as fast as in the past, and more areas are protected than ever. Between 2000 and 2015, Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay were able to increase the total protected forest area in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion by more than 20%. In Paraguay, the rate of deforestation has decreased between 82% to 95% since the baseline in 2003, thanks to the country’s zero-deforestation law, which was first enacted in 2004.

- CONSERVING JAGUARS
- CONVENING REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS
- BUILDING LOCAL COLLABORATIONS
- RESTORING FOREST

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CONSERVING JAGUARS

WWF’s forest protection and restoration efforts also focus on the jaguar, one of the Atlantic Forest’s keystone species. WWF monitors the approximately 300 jaguars that remain there as well as their primary prey and works to reduce the regional threats facing jaguars, including human-jaguar conflict, poaching, and unsustainable livestock production. Surveys showed a 160% increase in jaguar numbers between 2005–2018 in the Upper Paraná region, which can be partially attributed to improved habitat connectivity.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CONVENING REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS

A network of government, civil society, and private sector organizations is involved in restoration across the Atlantic Forest. WWF helps bring these stakeholders together to align on restoration strategies, leverage complementary efforts for the greatest impact, and ensure long-term buy-in from key players.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: BUILDING LOCAL COLLABORATIONS

WWF works with local civil society partners to build pipelines of landowners interested in doing restoration on their land; to ensure sufficient nursery capacity and supply of seedlings in support of the growing demand for restoration; and to implement restoration plantings and monitoring of seedlings.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: RESTORING FOREST

WWF uses the latest data to perform landscape analyses that identify the highest priority land parcels to restore to maximize connectivity among forest fragments, water supply and quality, and benefits for climate and communities. These analyses inform WWF’s restoration agenda and ensure investments are used as efficiently as possible. Our goal is to see 12 million hectares restored with native vegetation, or under restoration, by 2030 against a 2014 baseline.

## %THE SOUNDS OF BRAZIL’S ATLANTIC FOREST

Brazil’s Atlantic Forest is one of the most biodiverse in the world, with many species found nowhere else on the planet. The forest provides for the jaguars, sloths, butterflies, birds, and thousands of other species that call it home. And these animals make a lot of noise.

The variety of sounds in the Atlantic Forest is astounding. Listen closely and the dull buzz becomes the calls of frogs, insects, birds, and maybe even a capybara.

But human activity threatens this forest, putting critical habitat for these animals at risk. Expanding agriculture and pastureland, timber harvesting, and urban development have shrunk Brazil’s Atlantic Forest to roughly 12% of its original size, making it one of the most endangered biomes in the world.

WWF is working with local communities and organizations to restore this incredible place and the species that live there.

WWF and HP are on a journey to restore, protect, and improve the management of 1 million acres of forests worldwide. Brazil’s Atlantic Forest is one of the critical forest ecosystems we are working in. With HP’s support, between 2019 and 2022, the local teams in the Atlantic Forest have planted 390,735 seedlings of 220 different species of plants to help provide much-needed habitats to the thousands of species who reside here.

“When you reforest [an] area, what happens is that animals come and keep coming,” said Mauricio Nogueira, a nursery coordinator at REGUA, a local forest conservation organization in the Atlantic Forest.

We are proud to work with local forest conservation partners like REGUA to ensure the Atlantic Forest and all of its sounds are around for future generations to enjoy.

## %Atlantic Forest declared UN World Restoration Flagship

Stretching from northeast Brazil southward along the Atlantic coast and inland into northeast Argentina and eastern Paraguay, the Atlantic Forest is a complex landscape comprised of multiple ecosystems and tremendous biodiversity. It’s also one of the world’s most endangered biomes—having lost 88% of its original vegetation in Brazil alone.

For years, communities, individuals, and organizations have pulled together to restore the Atlantic Forest. Known as the Trinational Atlantic Forest Pact, their urgent and vital work is now officially declared by the United Nations as one of the 10 World Restoration Flagships.

With a shared goal of restoring 15 million hectares by 2050, the Trinational Atlantic Forest Pact is a transboundary coalition that brings together over 300 organizations to restore the Atlantic Forest. The coalition is led by the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact and the Trinational Alliance for the Atlantic Forest Restoration, which has organizations from Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.

The UN recognition acknowledges that restoration must go beyond planting trees and promote multiple benefits for nature and people, including generating work and income. “It is an inclusive and long-term process...respecting the local contexts and involving traditional communities and female empowerment. It is a commitment to the quality of life of thousands of people,” says Taruhim Quadros, representative of the Trinational Alliance for the Atlantic Forest Restoration and WWF-Brazil.

More than 20 evaluation criteria were considered for the World Restoration Flagship award, including involvement of local communities in decision-making, creation of coalitions, contribution to international agreements for reduction of emissions, growth potential, and replicability, among others.

Around the world, there were 156 proposals for the title of World Restoration Flagship, with the first 10 declared at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal, Canada. In addition to the Atlantic Forest, initiatives in Africa, Oceania, Central America, the Middle East, and Asia were named World Restoration Flagships.

## %How forest restoration takes root

When it comes to forests, the planet urgently needs us to do three things. First, stop deforestation. Second, sustainably manage forests so that they can continue to benefit people, nature, and wildlife. And third, restore forestland already lost where we can. Though in some places it may be impossible to truly restore all the diversity of life and benefits of a native forest, restoring a forest will still provide vital services for local communities, nature, and the rest of the world.

Tree-planting projects are commonplace, but rarer are projects that focus on bringing an entire forest back to life. The big reason? Forest landscape restoration is incredibly complicated, slow, and expensive. To restore a forest landscape—one that will thrive for generations into the future—every detail must be planned and adapted over time.

Much of forest landscape restoration happens before any trees go in the ground. Restoration requires mapping and analysis of thousands of acres to determine the smaller areas, towns, and individual parcels of land to prioritize. Local communities must be involved so that restoration experts understand their needs, challenges, and long-term goals for the land. Local individuals and forest scientists work together to develop an inclusive vision that identifies and supports alternative livelihoods, improves farming or sustainable forest management practices, and engages governments on laws and policies as parts of the planning process. This means lots of hard work with lots of people, but it’s all essential for forest landscape restoration to take root.

Forest restoration also requires a large and diverse mix of champions: individuals, businesses, governments, and organizations from all sectors and walks of life that understand the benefits of forestland and are willing to invest their time, energy, resources, and/or money into this work for the long term. When all the pieces come together, forest landscape restoration is nothing short of miraculous. We’re seeing this on the ground right now in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, thanks in large part to global companies stepping up to become forest champions.

### %How forest restoration takes root: A path forward for forests
In 2019, HP and WWF embarked on a groundbreaking partnership that, as part of a broader strategy to protect and improve the health of forests, included a goal of restoring over 1,000 acres of forestland in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest region. In only two years, and despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, we’ve engaged over 50 local institutions and 150 community stakeholders to secure their participation as part of the forest restoration process. In support of the Raízes do Mogi Guaçu project, 158 acres of land have been put under restoration, including more than 66,000 seedlings planted and 37 freshwater springs protected. And most importantly, this partnership has helped build a community-centered foundation to ensure these efforts will safeguard a thriving forest ecosystem in the long term.

The Raízes project is a gold standard for collaborative forest landscape restoration, with a commitment to put people first, ensuring that each project prioritizes listening to local stakeholders, social safeguards, and community benefits. There’s also always room for expansion—projects like this can be scaled up with additional partners and investment.

In October 2021, HP decided to do exactly that, growing the original WWF partnership to focus on the key components of forest conservation: protection, improved management, and restoration. While restoration is only one piece of the puzzle, this expanded partnership means more projects like Raízes, potentially totaling thousands of additional acres of restored forestland. HP has a goal to counteract potential deforestation and forest degradation for all paper used in HP products, regardless of brand, by 2030. And through this expanded partnership, WWF is helping HP achieve this ambition by addressing 17 million metric tons of paper used in HP printers over 10 years—the equivalent of sustainably managing, restoring, and protecting nearly 1 million acres of forest.

### %How forest restoration takes root: For climate, nature, and communities
Forest projects at this scale, with this depth and breadth, need more attention, collaboration, and patient investment if we are going to see the lasting benefits for our climate, nature, and communities that we desperately need. Because while planting trees can be good, there’s no comparison to bringing a forest back to life. In fact, there’s only one thing better than forest restoration: protecting and sustainably managing the forests we still have. As protection, restoration, and improved forest management partnerships are proving, we can meet all of humanity’s demands on forests without any further damage; and we can even give back to the planet in the process.

## %RESTORING BRAZIL’S ATLANTIC FOREST

The Rio do Peixe, which flows through the town of Socorro in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, was the color of chocolate. Liquid mud. It had been that way as long as Flavia and Ana Paula Balderi could remember. When they were teenagers, the sisters began to wonder why.

A teacher explained that a forest once stood between the river and the town, but the trees were no longer there. There was nothing to filter the byproducts of human activity, nothing to keep the silt of the riverbanks from mixing into the water, and nothing to safeguard the springs that supplied it. If the river were ever to recover, the forest would have to be restored.

Flavia and Ana Paula, 17 and 16 at the time, might have just gone back to doing whatever it is that teenagers do. But instead, along with Ana Paula’s future husband, Tiago Sartori, and his cousin, Richieri Sartori, they made the audacious decision to restore the forest themselves. The quartet called their project Copaíba, named after a tree that is one of more than 100 species planted locally to form riparian areas—areas known in this region as “the eyelashes of the river” for their ability to protect springs and control soil erosion.

That was 1999. In the early days, Flavia admits, the operation was a bit haphazard. The strategy, she says, was essentially to approach landowners and ask, “Do you want to plant a tree?” The young people had nowhere to source seedlings, so they relied on donations from the municipal garden in Socorro. “We didn’t have much by way of technique,” she says. “We didn’t have much knowledge about how to restore forests.”

The Balderi sisters studied biology and filled their knowledge gap, but the seedling supply problem persisted. Even when they started growing seedlings at the Sartori family farm in 2001, and a few years later in space provided by a local nursing home, they couldn’t keep up with demand. Then in 2014 they met with unexpected fortune. Two elderly women donated their 15-acre property to Copaíba, and production went from 4,000 or 5,000 seedlings per year to more than 100,000.

Today, Copaíba produces up to 500,000 seedlings a year. What began as an after-school project has grown into one of Brazil’s foremost restoration organizations—and a linchpin for WWF and its partners bringing their vision for the whole region to life.

### %RESTORING BRAZIL’S ATLANTIC FOREST: A fractured forest

The trees that once bordered that mud-brown river in Socorro were part of the vast Atlantic Forest, which centuries ago blanketed the eastern coast of Brazil and reached inland into Argentina and Paraguay. Today the Atlantic Forest region looks very different. Containing two of the most populous cities in the world—São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro—it is home to 148 million people.

“The Atlantic Forest was one of the world’s first tropical forests where Europeans arrived to explore and colonize,” says WWF-Brazil conservation manager Anna Carolina Lobo. Colonization, habitation, and commodity production have taken a massive toll: In Brazil, roughly 12% of the original forest remains.

But don’t count this forest out just yet. Seven percent of the world’s plant species and 5% of vertebrate species—jaguars, maned wolves, toucans, tamarin monkeys, ocelots—are found here; many exist nowhere else. “The forest manages, even with so many people living in it, even though it is so degraded, to continue to be one of the most biodiverse areas in the world,” says Lobo.

After so much destruction, Lobo says, people have begun to realize the importance of the forest and the need for restoration. And not just for the sake of wildlife. The forest purifies the air, helps regulate the climate, and is the source of water for 60% of Brazil’s population. “People’s lives and the national economy depend on it,” she says.

WWF and others have been doing restoration work here for years. But in 2009, those mostly independent efforts took a leap forward when the organization joined with institutions from the private sector, civil society, and the government in launching the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact. With the goal of restoring more than 37 million acres by 2050, the pact represents one of the largest habitat restoration efforts ever undertaken.

Today some 350 pact members collaborate on projects and draw on shared technical knowledge, best practices, and political clout. Projects emphasize community engagement at all stages and focus on priority areas where restoration can connect the Atlantic Forest’s remaining fragments and help restore water resources.

One priority is the Mogi Guaçu River basin, which includes Socorro and the Rio do Peixe. Here, where Flavia and Ana Paula first started, Copaíba is putting its growing enterprise to good use.

### %RESTORING BRAZIL’S ATLANTIC FOREST: Rooted in partnership

In 2018, WWF and International Paper, one of the world’s largest packaging, pulp, and paper companies, created the Raízes do Mogi Guaçu project (which translates roughly as the Roots of Mogi Guaçu). Under the umbrella of the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact, the project aims to restore nearly 250 acres of forest along rivers in the watershed.

Daniel Venturi, a WWF-Brazil conservation analyst who works on the project, says this work is more complex than just planting trees—and it results in multiple benefits. “The Atlantic Forest, due to its history of degradation over the centuries, is a very fragmented forest,” he says, explaining that reconnecting those fragments through restoration, even one acre at a time, creates corridors that allow wildlife to move more freely. The restored regions protect crucial water sources by helping to regulate soil erosion, filter out pollutants, and maintain watershed stability.

WWF’s role is to create the necessary conditions for restoration, including mobilizing actors with a stake and interest in the region—additional private companies, local universities, rural producers, and municipalities. “Much of what’s left, those forest fragments, is in private areas,” says Venturi. And even though restoration efforts usually target degraded areas with little or no agricultural value—because many people here can’t afford to have their livelihoods compromised—the program can still be a hard sell. That’s why groups like Copaíba, which have existing partnerships and relationships with private landowners, are key.

International Paper’s investments in forest restoration align with the company’s core values, says chief sustainability officer Sophie Beckham. “As a global company, and one of the largest fiber buyers in the world, we feel it’s important to contribute to efforts to ensure healthy and abundant forests.” Such investments are also a strategic business decision. Investing in places where the company doesn’t source fiber, Beckham says, helps develop knowledge and techniques to ensure the health and productivity of areas where it does.

Along with all of São Paulo State, the region around International Paper’s eucalyptus plantations and mills has recently suffered from extreme drought—a water scarcity that has impacted both the company’s operations and the local communities. But the company’s investment is working to protect the critical water resources on which both depend. The hope is that increasing forest connectivity and helping landowners to plant trees will make the region’s water resources more resilient to future crises. “The nexus of forest and water stewardship is really in focus with this reforestation work,” says Beckham.

None of this would be possible, she adds, without partnership. “The collaboration between International Paper and WWF facilitates knowledge sharing; allows us to jointly reach out to diverse stakeholders, such as landowners, to engage them as catalysts for change; and ultimately lays the groundwork for scaling up the project with additional partners,” she says. “These are the critical building blocks of true systems change, which we could never achieve by simply planting trees on our own.”

### %RESTORING BRAZIL’S ATLANTIC FOREST: Building bridges

WWF-Brazil’s Venturi concurs that landowners are key catalysts. He emphasizes that engaging local stakeholders from the very beginning is vital to ensuring that the people who live in the landscape, who are impacted most by the work, are the ones who own it.

“It’s an approach that comes from the bottom up,” says Venturi. “That is a story of hope. You bring people together who want to help the forest recover.”

One of those people is Ellen Souza Pinto Fontana, a fifth-generation coffee farmer in Mogi Guaçu. The acres she is restoring will connect to areas of existing forest on her land—forest she credits with her farm’s wealth of water and relative lack of pests and diseases. “I imagine that everything will live together well,” she says, “the crop and forest together. I think this balance is good for the business, good for the family, and good for our soul.”

Fontana wants her daughter, now three years old, to have a prosperous future on the land that has served her family for generations. Moreover, she says, “living in a balance between coffee production and the environment provides a benefit not only for our family but for all the other people who will enjoy these resources.”

The restored forest on Fontana’s land will bridge to another fragment of land belonging to José Fernandes, her neighbor and fellow project participant. Together, their restoration efforts will connect an expanse of forest covering nearly 500 acres.

Fernandes is the owner of Colina dos Sonhos (Hill of Dreams), a resort priding itself on environmental sustainability. He thinks of the Raízes project as an opportunity to contribute to a better country and world. But he also expects an economic return.

“We really believe that with this type of project we will be able to improve the quality of tourism locally,” Fernandes says. “Because one of the big goals of tourist activities here in this area is to observe wildlife.” And here, he says, “you can’t do tourism without conservation.”

### %RESTORING BRAZIL’S ATLANTIC FOREST: Growth patterns

Restoring an acre here and a few acres there may sound like slow work, but it quickly adds up. “In the past few years we have seen around 2.5 million acres restored,” WWF’s Lobo says. “And when the forest is healthier, natural springs return, the water comes back, life returns. This demonstrates how resilient the forest is. It gives us hope that what we’re doing is worthwhile.”

But, she says, if the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact wants to meet the goal of restoring 37 million acres, more corporate investment is needed.

In the Mogi Guaçu region, additional investment has already arrived. In 2019, technology company HP Inc., a long-standing supply chain partner of International Paper, committed to build on the progress of the Raízes work by restoring an additional 250 acres of forest and watershed in the region as well as nearly 1,000 acres in other Atlantic Forest priority areas. The first round of tree planting began in late 2020.

“We set a zero-deforestation goal to ensure all of our HP brand paper and paper-based product packaging is derived from certified and recycled sources—a goal we’ve now met for nearly 100% of our supply,” says Ellen Jackowski, chief sustainability and social impact officer at HP. “But we know responsible sourcing is just one part of the equation. It’s time for companies to give back more to forests than we take out.”

Linda Walker, senior director of corporate engagement for forests at WWF-US, says this idea of giving back is catching on. “More and more companies are asking how they can go beyond just reducing their footprint to make a positive impact on the planet, for nature and for people,” she says. WWF is responding with an initiative called Forests Forward, which will launch in the United States this year.

The program will build on the success of WWF’s Global Forest & Trade Network, which over two decades has engaged more than 150 companies in 18 countries to produce and source forest products more sustainably. With Forests Forward, Walker says, WWF is challenging companies to scale up their actions. “Our goal is to tackle deforestation and forest degradation globally and work to restore the resilience and extent of forests we’ve already lost,” she says.

Forests Forward participants will commit to sourcing responsibly, supporting community-based restoration and other on-the-ground efforts, and advocating for policies that help keep forests thriving. “We’re confident that with enough companies embracing this model and recognizing that better forests mean better business,” Walker says, “we can make significant progress toward global sustainability goals.”

### %RESTORING BRAZIL’S ATLANTIC FOREST: Planting the seed

Back at Copaíba headquarters, the Balderi sisters are focused, as always, on the future—a future where the trees they plant today become the canopy of a lush forest. They’re also focused on the next generation of forest guardians. From the beginning, Copaíba has worked to educate local school groups about the importance of the forest, and over the years some students have even convinced their parents to plant on their properties. “From the moment people are involved by taking on the importance of conservation, of restoration,” Flavia says, “we are protecting the forest.”

There’s no better proof than Flavia herself. “We were a group of young people who came together with motivation and a dream,” she says. With each passing year the trees grow taller and the Rio do Peixe, cleaner.

And in a few decades, when the area along the river mirrors a native forest, it will all be traced back to that one seed of a dream.

## %A hilltop coffee plantation benefits from robust and healthy forests

On a hilltop in southeast Brazil, 4,500 feet above the surrounding landscape, is a coffee plantation that has been operating in the same family for more than 150 years—five generations. The owner and proprietor is Ellen Fontana, a woman dedicated to both her land and her family. A respect for nature grounds her business; she employs sustainable practices to minimize water use, avoid pesticides, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Her dedication and attention yield award-winning specialty coffee and a successful business, one she hopes will continue through future generations.

But in the past few years, her vision of the future has been shaken. The planet is changing—rapidly—and whether coffee production will remain viable in her area in 20 or 50 years is a legitimate concern.

“I heard from my grandparents that it used to rain a lot in January, and the dry and rainy seasons were more clearly defined,” Fontana says. “And now, for a few years, we have noticed irregularity in rainfall, high temperature peaks, hail.”

Fontana’s home in the state of São Paulo is part of the Atlantic Forest ecoregion, an area that has been ravaged by centuries of deforestation. In 2014, the region experienced its worst drought in nearly a century, leading to an unprecedented water crisis. More than 140 cities in Brazil had to ration water; coffee plantations lost up to a third of their crops. And February 2020 was the rainiest month in the region’s recorded history, resulting in catastrophic floods. When your livelihood depends on the predictability of the seasons, it’s a scary reality.

But Fontana has fared better than many, thanks in part to her hilltop location and a significant area of natural forest that she and her family have maintained on their land.

“We are in a microregion with a lot of preserved forest, and we have a lot of water,” she says. “This microclimate helps a lot in the balance of crops.”

### %A hilltop coffee plantation benefits from robust and healthy forests: Why farmers depend on healthy forests

Healthy forests are critical for wildlife and ecosystems, but they also provide services to people. For farmers especially, these services can help keep land productive and resilient in the face of uncertain conditions. A forest can act as a buffer from the elements, recharging groundwater reserves, preventing soil erosion, shielding crops from extreme winds, and mitigating flooding. Forests also help preserve water quality by filtering nutrient runoff from fertilizers.

Fontana decided to maximize these benefits by restoring additional forest habitat on her property, connecting the span of natural forest on her land to another forest fragment on a neighboring property. As a participant in the Raizes do Mogi Guaçu project—a partnership between International Paper and WWF—Fontana was able to begin the restoration process in late 2019. Copaíba, a local forest restoration organization, has worked with her as part of the Raizes project to prepare the land, plant seedlings, and monitor the adolescent forest to make sure it continues to thrive.

Fontana says that farmers, inherently connected to the land, understand better than anyone how important conservation is. But with a thin profit margin and an overwhelming workload, investing the money and time to restore forest land without help is impractical, if not impossible.

“Most of the time, we are trying to save, trying to manage our crops and our business,” she says. “And sometimes reforestation ends up being put off till tomorrow. So, when we have partners like Copaíba, like WWF, and International Paper, who come to help and make this happen, for us it is essential.”

The parcel of land that Fontana is restoring is small, only a couple acres, but these small patches of restored forests will build up to something impressive. The original goal of the Raizes project was to restore nearly 250 acres in the Mogi Guaçu region. Thanks to additional investment from HP, that target has doubled. And this project is part of something even larger—The Atlantic Forest Pact, a coalition of more than 280 member organizations working to restore 37 million acres. “If everyone can do a little bit,” Fontana says, “there will be a result in the future.”

For Fontana, that result is deeply personal: a thriving business that she will be able to pass on to her daughter. “I think that living in a balance between coffee production and the environment that we live in provides a benefit not only for our family but for all the other people who will enjoy these resources,” she says. “I think this balance is good for the business, good for the family, and good for our soul.”
