# %MADAGASCAR

The island nation of Madagascar has developed its own distinct ecosystems and extraordinary wildlife since it split from the African continent an estimated 160 million years ago. Approximately 95 percent of Madagascar’s reptiles, 89 percent of its plant life, and 92 percent of its mammals exist nowhere else on Earth.

Located off the east coast of Africa, Madagascar is the world’s fifth largest island; at 144 million acres, it’s almost the size of Texas. Madagascar’s climate is tropical along the coast, temperate inland, and arid in the south. The island harbors lush rain forests, tropical dry forests, plateaus and deserts. Its more than 3,000 miles of coastline and over 250 islands are home to some of the world’s largest coral reef systems and most extensive mangrove areas in the Western Indian Ocean.

CONTINENT: Africa
SPECIES: Lemur, Tortoise, Gecko, Chameleon

## %SPECIES

A dizzying range of plants and animals make their home on the island. More than 11,000 endemic plant species, including seven species of baobab tree, share the island with a vast variety of mammal, reptiles, amphibians, and others. From 1999 to 2010, scientists discovered 615 new species in Madagascar, including 41 mammals and 61 reptiles.

Madagascar has several critically threatened species including the Silky Sifaka, a lemur, which is one of the rarest mammals on earth. Its name—“angel of the forest"—refers to its white fur. Another threatened species, the rare Ploughshare tortoise, is found only in a small area of northwestern Madagascar where as few as 1,000 of these animals survive. Ploughshare tortoises can be sold illegally for up to $200,000 on exotic pet markets.

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

The diversity of the island is seen everywhere. Madagascar is home to more than 21 million people with a wide array of faiths and customs. The Malagasy (as the people of Madagascar are known) are descendents of settlers from Borneo and East Africa and draw their cultural heritage from Southeast Asia, India, Africa, and the Middle East.

More than 20 ethnic groups coexist on the island. Their common language, also called Malagasy, is most closely related to a language spoken in southeast Borneo. A majority of the population—80 percent of which is estimated to live below the poverty line—depends on subsistence farming for survival.

## %THREATS

Madagascar’s stunning species and unique habitats are threatened by demands from today’s global markets and from the growing needs of the local population.

The main threats are:

- ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE
- DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

For the unique species of the island, loss of vital habitat is a disaster and the increased access to species has also exacerbated the international trade in Madagascar’s wildlife. Today, many animals and plants are threatened, with rosewood trees, tortoises, chameleons, geckos and snakes the most targeted by traffickers.

### %THREATS: DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION

The small-scale but widespread clearance of forests, primarily for firewood and charcoal production, is jeopardizing the island’s habitats. As a result, several charismatic species such as lemurs and chameleons that evolved here over millions of years may become extinct before the end of the century.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

WWF aims to protect, restore and maintain Madagascar’s unique biodiversity in harmony with the culture and livelihoods of the local people. We work closely with governments, scientists, industry and local communities on several areas that present the best opportunities to secure the future for the island’s people and species.

They are:

- SUSTAINING LIVELIHOODS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES
- ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE
- PROTECTING THE DRY AND SPINY FORESTS

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: SUSTAINING LIVELIHOODS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES

WWF works with traditional fishermen and government authorities to manage marine and coastal resources so that they not only contribute to conservation but also benefit local communities.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE

WWF helps decision makers, technical officers, and local authorities to develop and implement responsive strategies to protect local communities and natural ecosystems from the expected impacts of climate change.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING THE DRY AND SPINY FORESTS

WWF has developed a plan to address immediate threats to Madagascar’s southernmost forests and help local communities manage their natural resources more sustainably.

## %MIGHTY MANGROVES

Mangroves are a vibrant part of coastal wetlands on five continents. These trees grow in saltwater with distinctive roots that sprawl above and below water in thick, muddy soils. Not only are they unparalleled for forests at storing carbon, which helps fight the climate crisis, they also sustain life for humans and an array of animals and plants that live in oceans and rivers.

But mangroves face several threats, from pollution to clearing for shrimp farming to palm oil production or other food production. An estimated 54% of mangrove loss in several Southeast Asian countries is due to shrimp farming. WWF is working around the world to restore landscapes where mangroves have been lost and support policies that protect them in the future through partnerships with local communities living near these coastal forests and collaborating with other organizations through groups like the Global Mangrove Alliance.

Here are some of the most diverse coastal forests around the world:

- North America: The Everglades
- Asia: The Sundarbans
- South America: The Galápagos Islands
- Oceana: New Guinea
- Africa: Madagascar

### %MIGHTY MANGROVES: North America: The Everglades

Everglades National Park in Florida is home to the largest mangrove forest in the United States. While mangroves are found along the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, and throughout much of southern Florida, the national park status of the Everglades allows a unique mix of wildlife—such as Florida panthers, American alligators, manatees, and over 360 different bird species like spoonbills, storks, and egrets—to live with minimal human interference. Without those protections, manatees and mangroves are both at risk. WWF has four recommendations to save Florida wildlife, which are a worthwhile investment because mangroves protect against extreme weather by buffering hurricane-strength winds and waves that could cause massive damage to infrastructure and loss of human life.

### %MIGHTY MANGROVES: Asia: The Sundarbans

The Sundarban National Park of India and the Sundarban Forest of Bangladesh cross country borders to make up one of the largest connected mangrove forests in the world. The word “sundarban” refers to the species of mangrove abundant in these wetlands, commonly known as the sunder or sundari (Heritiera fomes) tree. Not only is the forest impressive for its sprawl, but it is also home to an abundance of wildlife including spotted deer, saltwater crocodiles, and endangered Bengal tigers. WWF is working to protect tigers around the world by supporting the restoration of tiger habitat, monitoring tiger populations—including those in the Sundarbans—and ending illegal wildlife trade.  

### %MIGHTY MANGROVES: South America: The Galápagos Islands

The Galápagos Islands form a bridge between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres off the coast of Ecuador. The archipelago is home to mangroves that must be extremely resilient to survive amid forceful wave action, lava fields, and lack of permanent freshwater streams. The remoteness of the islands and their protected status through an international agreement provides a refuge from human development, leaving the forests close to pristine. This allows the mangroves to provide shelter and nutrition for many animals found nowhere else on earth, like the Galápagos penguin (the only penguin species that lives north of the Equator), the mangrove finch (critically endangered and the rarest bird in the Galápagos), and Galápagos sea lions. However, climate change and plastic pollution pose increasing risks to the Galápagos. WWF is working to find solutions to preserve these iconic islands.

### %MIGHTY MANGROVES: Oceana: New Guinea

The island of New Guinea is the second-largest in the world and has extensive and diverse mangrove forests. Like many other wetlands, the mangroves of New Guinea provide valuable resources to local communities. Major examples are fish and shellfish like mud lobster and mangrove crabs that are harvested for food in the muddy streams beneath the 37 species of mangrove trees present on the island. The ecosystems also serve as nurseries for marine animals that move out to coral reefs or the open ocean when they mature. Having a well-protected nursery benefits the support and restoration of coral reefs, which is extremely valuable to coastal communities that build their livelihoods through tourism or fishing on the reefs. Local culture and traditions are also tied to the forests, helping to sustain a sense of community and connection among island residents.

### %MIGHTY MANGROVES: Africa: Madagascar

Off the coast of East Africa, Madagascar has an abundance of extraordinary wildlife living among mangroves such as Nile crocodiles, sea turtles, dugongs, over 20 species of lemur, and birds such as the Madagascar fish-eagle. Unfortunately, mangrove deforestation is occurring around the world, including Madagascar, to clear land for development or shrimp aquaculture, and wood for building materials and charcoal. To counter this, WWF supports global mangrove replanting projects and cartographic surveys through the Global Mangrove Alliance to bring back the vibrancy of these ecosystems, helping wildlife, people, and the climate.

## %In Madagascar, wildlife abounds on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure

MADAGASCAR

I knew the island of Madagascar is sometimes called the eighth continent, owing to its size and rich biodiversity. But no amount of research could prepare me for its stunning variety of landscapes and wildlife. In the span of just a couple of hundred miles, I traveled from tropical rain forests straight out of Jurassic Park through grasslands to coastal mangroves.

Geographically isolated, Madagascar has developed unique ecosystems with many endemic species—95% of the country’s reptiles, 89% of its plants, and 92% of its mammals (including more than 100 species of lemurs) are found nowhere else.

While too many of these species are endangered or facing extinction, national parks—as well as community-led and tourism-driven conservation projects—have been critical to saving flora and fauna from illegal hunting and deforestation. The Anja Community Reserve, for example, protects a forest that’s home to globally loved ring-tailed lemurs, and proceeds have helped fund water treatment, medical, and school facilities for the community. To the north, the Anjajavy Lodge manages a 17,000-acre private nature reserve and runs a variety of conservation programs, from reintroducing aye-aye lemurs and rewilding giant tortoises to restoring mangroves and monitoring baobab trees for disease.

My favorite lemur was the indri. The largest lemur in Madagascar, the species is locally called the father of the forest and is known for its hauntingly beautiful call. Another adventurer described it as a whale song played on a trumpet. To me, it was otherworldly, and hearing its voice echo through the trees was an experience I’ll never forget.

## %A rare sighting inspires visitors to Madagascar's coastal forests

ANJAJAVY NATURE RESERVE :: MADAGASCAR

As our boat weaves among Moramba Bay’s tsingy islands—towering limestone formations that jut from the water—our naturalist guide points to the treetops. “There, look!” It’s one of the most coveted bird sightings in the world: a critically endangered Madagascar fish eagle.

We’re lucky to spy this rare raptor: Fewer than 300 remain in the wild, and they’re found only on this coastal strip of northwest Madagascar, with a handful of breeding pairs in this vicinity. Our group is on an excursion from Anjajavy Nature Reserve, on Natural Habitat Adventures’ Madagascar Wildlife Safari, exploring the mangrove forest that provides habitat for the fish eagle and other at-risk species.

Mangroves flank the Anjajavy Peninsula, holding nesting sites for birds and sea turtles, sheltering commercially valuable crab and shrimp, and supporting high levels of connectivity between ecosystems such as coral reefs and seagrass beds. With stilt-like root systems, mangroves also trap mud, filter water, and safeguard coastlines against tidal surges. And they’re incredible carbon sinks, able to store up to four times more carbon than tropical rain forests.

But these important ecosystems are disappearing quickly, our guide explains. They’re threatened by sea level rise, upstream erosion, and deforestation. Madagascar lost about 21% of its mangroves between 1990 and 2010. But since 2007, WWF has partnered with 16 Malagasy communities to help protect and regenerate these incredibly biodiverse coastal forests.

As we return to shore, we feel enlightened. We’ve discovered the intricacies of a single rich ecosystem—and we recognize how fortunate we are to witness it for ourselves.

## %A hue-shifting chameleon's island home is under threat

MASOALA NATIONAL PARK :: MADAGASCAR

Panther chameleons (Furcifer panthera) are masters of disguise. By adjusting the distance between light-reflecting nanoscale crystals in their skin, these lizards can change their color and brightness, blending into their surroundings or exhibiting a colorful display. When relaxed, panther chameleons are naturally camouflaged to evade predators. But when aggressive or amorous, they undergo kaleidoscopic transformations, which help them defend their territory or attract mates.

Of the more than 200 known chameleon species, nearly half (including the panther chameleon) occur only on Madagascar—a 146-million-acre island nation off the east coast of Africa that has over 3,000 miles of coastline, harboring lush rain forests and the most extensive mangrove ecosystems in the Western Indian Ocean. The island is home to remarkable, unique biodiversity: Roughly 90% of its animals and plants are found nowhere else on Earth.

Unfortunately, threats to the island’s flora and fauna abound. Rampant forest clearing, illegal wildlife trade, and climate change have pushed several species, including some chameleons, to near extinction. To halt further losses and conserve the island’s natural resources, WWF is (1) working with the government to set new targets for sustainable development; (2) supporting projects to restore degraded forests and ecosystems; and (3) facilitating community trainings on ecotourism. This suite of undertakings, among other initiatives, will protect biodiversity as well as people’s health and livelihoods.

## %Madagascar’s ‘solar grandmothers’ lead a renewable revolution

n the small village of Ambakivao, Madagascar, a group of women have stepped up to become their community’s first solar engineers. These volunteers—dubbed the solar grandmothers—are working to bring electricity to nearly 200 families in their village.

Traditionally, their community used petroleum lamps for lighting their homes. Now they have implemented solar lamps for lighting and other household tasks. The use of solar energy reduces pollution and the community’s overall footprint.

Remeza, Kingeline, Yollande and Hanitra are all part of WWF’s access to sustainable energy program managed in collaboration with India’s Barefoot College. The four women joined women from several other countries for a six-month training in India in applied solar technology. Most women joining the program leave their country, sometimes their native regions or villages, for the first time in their lives.

Along with technical training, the program also brings new economic and leadership opportunities for the women. “We are here to learn solar engineering,” says Hanitra. “It's a men thing back there in Mabolo. But here, the ones mastering it are women. It's thrilling to see that women and men, we can do it equally.”

The training is intended for women from remote villages in developing countries but communities participate—and benefit—too. Volunteer applicants for the training are chosen at a village meeting. The village also elects a solar committee to run the administrative, social and financial aspects of the solar program and ensure its financial sustainability.

“I really feel that everything we've learned here will be good for where we're from. It's innovative and so crucial for our village and our living,” says Yollande. “From what I've seen here in India, the women are getting the job done.”

## %Communities come together to restore mangroves

Mangroves protect and stabilize coastlines – particularly important as climate change brings more extreme storms and increased wave action. They also act as sinks, sequestering 3–5 percent more carbon per unit area than any other forest system. But mangroves are disappearing, cleared for urban and tourism development or felled for fuel and building materials.

Wise use of mangroves, such as creating coastal reserves and helping local communities develop livelihoods built on keeping them intact, is crucial for nature and people.

The most extensive mangrove cover, about a million hectares bordering the Western Indian Ocean, is found in the river deltas of Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania. As an ecozone between land and sea, mangroves are home to a huge variety of creatures, from birds and land mammals to dugongs, five marine turtle species and many kinds of fish. And much of the economically important prawn harvest along this coast depends on mangroves for safe spawning and nursery grounds.

In the Melaky region on Madagascar’s west coast, local people are taking action to remedy the loss of mangroves, which are crucial to their livelihoods. Since September 2015, men, women and children from the village of Manombo have become key players in mangrove conservation and restoration.

Mangrove restoration benefits local communities by improving access to fish and crab stock, which provide a regular income, and builds resilience against climate change. The village community participated in a reforestation campaign, planting around 9,000 mangrove seedlings to restore degraded forests around their village. Next to Manombo, other communities have together planted 49,000 seedlings. For the local communities and the future of their forests, that equals a real success.

## %A world apart: the unique spirit of Madagascar

ZOMBITSE-VOHIBASIA NATIONAL PARK :: MADAGASCAR

We hear rustling in the dry leaf litter below us. A tiny Appert’s tetraka bird hops from one twig to another, yellow feathers flashing. All around us, eyes peer out of the holes in hollow trees. We see three lemur species in 30 minutes.

Much of the life around us evolved in isolation, or was brought here by humans in the last 2,000 years. Nine out of 10 of Madagascar’s species exist nowhere else on Earth. Today, these endemics are confined to fragments of coastline, and to humid, dry, and spiny forests that are surrounded by the scars of fire.

Our guides look to the horizon with concern. They need to leave us— flames are lapping at the dry forest edge beyond a distant baobab tree. Trenches must be dug to protect what is left in this park.

For the people of Madagascar, fire has been a powerful tool. Fire has cleared rain forests for rice. Fire has cleared spiny forests for charcoal. Fire has cleared deciduous forests for cattle. Fire has been used to express dissent in times of colonial oppression. When communities were small, the land could recover. But now, with the population doubling roughly every 20 years, the pressures are too great.

Madagascar is a proud island. In our travels we find communities generous beyond their means; people are unfailingly kind. It is this human energy, coupled with truly unique biodiversity, that drives my hope for the island’s future.

## %Empowering Women in Madagascar through Solar Technology

In March 2013, seven women left their villages in southeastern Madagascar for a six-month training course in solar technology at the Barefoot College in India. They were the first participants in a creative new partnership between WWF and the college, and they returned home ready to light up their villages.

## %Catching a Sticky Predator in the Act

In December 2011, Italian photographer Giovanni Mari took off on a photo expedition to eastern Madagascar. While walking in the forests of Andasibe-Mantadia, Mari spotted a massive Parson’s chameleon clasping a low branch in full sunlight. It felt like a gift.

“Parson’s chameleons are normally found hunched amidst the shadowy depths of dark rain forests,” Mari says. “Having so great an opportunity with such a beautiful specimen—and the ideal level of light,” he adds, inspired him to spend an entire morning taking shots of the chameleon’s ticking, light-speed movements as it snatched bugs from the air.

The chameleon’s bulbous, sticky tongue was incredibly fast. Mari shot in 8-frames-per-second bursts at a shutter speed of 1/1250; only one shot showed the tongue extension. Right before each strike, the chameleon exposed a small part of its tongue for one or two seconds, giving Mari the barest sliver of time in which to press the shutter release.

Like lemurs, the radiated tortoise and most Malagasy species, Parson’s chameleons are endemic to Madagascar, meaning they can only be found living naturally in the wild on this one island. Unfortunately, like much of the island’s unique wildlife, they are threatened by deforestation and wildlife trade.
