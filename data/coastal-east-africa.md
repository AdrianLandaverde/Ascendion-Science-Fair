# %COASTAL EAST AFRICA

Coastal East Africa encompasses a beautiful tapestry of land and sea—from mountains and grasslands to mangroves and fringing coral reefs. Within this region, WWF works in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique and the western part of the Indian Ocean. Elephants, rhinos, lions, wild dogs, and more iconic species roam the landscape. Along the coasts, you can find dugongs, whale sharks, dolphins, whales, and five species of marine turtles. The waters of the Western Indian Ocean also support globally important shrimp and tuna industries.

For all its richness, the region also has some of the highest rates of people living below the poverty line on the planet. People here depend on the region’s natural resources—clean freshwater, healthy forests and mangroves, and abundant fish and wildlife. These resources must be managed sustainably to ensure their future. Local communities need the ability to protect their resources against illegal activities.

CONTINENT: Africa
SPECIES: Marine Turtle, African elephant, Black rhino, White rhino, Great white shark, Dugong, Whale shark

## %SPECIES

Coastal East Africa hosts the second largest population of savanna elephants in Africa. Wild dogs, black rhinos and lions also roam its forests and grasslands. Along the beaches and within coral reefs and seagrass beds, five species of marine turtles nest and feed: green turtle, hawksbill, olive ridley, loggerhead and leatherback. Whales, dolphins, dugongs and whale sharks inhabit these Indian Ocean waters. And four species of commercially important tuna—bigeye, albacore, yellowfin and skipjack—are found here.

The region also provides habitat for threatened shorebirds and seabirds, including the sooty tern, the masked booby, the greater crested tern, and the brown noddy. The Kiunga Marine National Reserve in Kenya supports the world's largest breeding colony of roseate terns.

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

WWF works with local communities, governments and industry to create awareness and appreciation for the connection between nature and people. We assist local communities in securing management rights to their local wildlife and fisheries. We work on sustainable use of natural resources, such as certified timber or fisheries, which also creates incentives for conservation. WWF strives to ensure that local people benefit from economic opportunities that come with new tourism enterprises.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: HELPING PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE COEXIST

WWF strives to develop practical solutions to address the conflict that frequently occurs between people and wildlife. In and around Quirimbas National Park in northern Mozambique, we have worked with farmers to minimize physical confrontation with elephants, protect crop fields and save lives. The use of deterrents—noise or chili peppers—has resulted in a dramatic reduction of conflicts and crop field destruction.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: IMPROVING FARMING

WWF works with farmers to develop climate “smart” solutions that conserve natural resources and protect wildlife habitats, while improving local food security and incomes. We encourage the use of drought resistant and high yield crops—such as maize and beans—and distribute improved seed varieties. We work with famers to improve soil fertility, resulting in greater yield on less land. This also leaves more habitat for wildlife and keeps farms close to home.

To provide further sources of income—and also serve as markers for property boundaries—WWF helped incorporate citrus trees. We also introduced a new program of raising goats and offered improved husbandry techniques to reduce the animals’ impact on vegetation and crops.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: INCREASING SUSTAINABLE FISHING

Approximately 55,000 people live in or around the Quirimbas marine reserve off the coast of Mozambique. Nearly all of them rely directly on its marine resources for their livelihoods. Villagers found that the small no-take zones that allowed fish stocks to rebound also produced an abundance of oysters. WWF and partners have helped fishermen create a sustainable oyster harvesting system, resulting in increased profits and yield.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION

In Tanzania, WWF works with partners to help improve lives and protect wildlife through the creation of Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs)—communal lands where local communities participate in the management of wildlife and resources. WMAs create opportunities for wildlife tourism, which directly benefits local communities through jobs and revenue. For example, men from local villages are now employed as game scouts, patrolling for poachers over hundreds of miles, often on foot. This protection of wildlife creates a strong and sustainable incentive for conservation. WWF’s goal is to have over 31 million acres of land in Tanzania managed in this way, which will help wildlife migration outside of protected areas.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- OVERFISHING
- BYCATCH
- ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED FISHING
- DEFORESTATION
- ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE
- HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT
- CLIMATE CHANGE

### %THREATS: OVERFISHING

Overfishing—for local consumption and export to commercial markets—poses a major threat to the region.

### %THREATS: BYCATCH

The health of stocks is wavering, particularly for tunas such as yellowfin and bigeye. Some fishing practices are causing unacceptable amounts of bycatch—threatening shark, marine turtles and seabird populations.

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED FISHING

Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing may account for as much as a third of total catches in some important fisheries in the region, and the capacity for local enforcement is severely lacking. Foreigners operate large-scale industrial fisheries along the coast, exporting most of the catch.

### %THREATS: DEFORESTATION

Overharvesting of timber and illegal commercial logging continue to threaten forests in Coastal East Africa. An ever-growing population dependent on timber and fuel wood continues to put pressure on this dwindling natural resource. The situation is exacerbated by large-scale illegal logging, which is often exported to international markets. Logging also opens up previously inaccessible forests to poachers and illegal wildlife traders.

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

Rising demand and weak enforcement have led to a higher incidence of elephant poaching and increasing ivory markets. Wildlife crime networks are using more sophisticated weapons and techniques to obtain ivory, such as automatic rifles and helicopters. Mozambique, Tanzania and Kenya are not only sources of ivory, but also major conduits for illegal wildlife trade. Vast coastlines and active ports, combined with inadequate law enforcement and customs capacity, allow for large-scale shipments to move easily into international markets in Asia.

### %THREATS: HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT

The second largest population of savanna elephants in Africa roam across this region in search of food and freshwater. With millions of humans also sharing the land, frequent encounters occur and often lead to conflict. Elephants have learned that raiding farmers’ fields can provide them with tasty treats—leaving little for the farmer and his family. Farmers are often killed while trying to defend their fields and elephants become the source of resentment and anger by the local communities.

### %THREATS: CLIMATE CHANGE

This region already suffers from unpredictable rainfall and frequent drought, along with intense rains and flooding. Coastal storms bring stronger winds creating greater wave damage along shorelines. Weather extremes also severely threaten the region’s traditional livelihoods of farming and fishing. In rural areas, people have lost crops and livestock and face hunger and outbreaks of malaria. Climate change is expected to intensify these and other problems. Warming seawaters threaten the incredible diversity associated with the regions’ coral reefs, leading to die-offs from bleaching. Coastal erosion threatens the nesting beaches of marine turtles and harms mangrove forests—which are already being battered from increased storm surges, and vulnerable to future sea level rise.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

They are:

- PROTECTING FRESHWATER AREAS
- ESTABLISHING MARINE PROTECTED AREAS
- CREATING SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES
- PRESERVING FREEDOM TO ROAM
- SAVING COASTAL FORESTS
- COMBATING ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE
- ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE
- PROTECTING MARINE TURTLES

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING FRESHWATER AREAS

Lake Niassa is an important source of freshwater, home to over 1000 fish species and critical to the livelihoods of the people of Mozambique. Threatened by illegal fishing, agricultural pollution and surrounding forest degradation, WWF worked to protect this area for future generations. In 2011 with WWF’s support, the government of Mozambique officially created the Lake Niassa Reserve. Lake Niassa is located in Mozambique and shares borders with Malawi and Tanzania. It spans 11,430 square miles (Mozambique’s portion is 2,470 square miles), is the eighth largest fresh water lake in the world and second deepest in Africa.

WWF also facilitated the organization of local fishing communities and helped build their capacity to combat illegal fishing, create alternative sources of income, and implement environmental education programs. Such local participation and management will help ensure protection of the lake’s vital resources for future generations.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ESTABLISHING MARINE PROTECTED AREAS

WWF helped Mozambique establish the Quirimbas marine reserve in 2002. The park is Africa’s largest marine protected area—rich with coral reefs, dugongs, dolphins, marine turtles, whales, sharks and hundreds of species of fish. Local communities play a critical role in management and patrolling of the area, and have established sanctuaries (no-fishing zones) that allow for the recovery of depleted fish stocks and corals. WWF has also helped community fishing councils gain authority to combat illegal fishing in the reserve. Increased numbers of fish in the sanctuary areas benefit local fishermen who catch more fish in the surrounding areas, and have fueled a profitable tourism industry.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CREATING SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES

In the Western Indian Ocean, WWF works to transform the way fisheries are managed in order to achieve sustainability. One area of work focuses on tuna, as we seek to help fisheries achieve certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). We also work towards MSC certification for the deep water shrimp fishery in Mozambique. To reduce illegal fishing, WWF supports local rangers who monitor artisanal fisheries. Through our involvement in the creation of local fishing associations, fishermen are recruited to monitor bycatch of turtles and dugongs and provide us with important data on population trends.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PRESERVING FREEDOM TO ROAM

Elephants and other wildlife require freedom to roam in search of food and freshwater. There are protected wildlife areas in southern Tanzania and northern Mozambique, but they are separated by areas with large human populations. Wildlife need corridors to move safely and easily between protected areas. WWF works with government and communities to develop land use plans that allow wildlife movement and human use to coexist.

We work with farmers to adopt practices that conserve resources and use less space, ensuring forest remains intact for wildlife. We help them increase crop yield, improving livelihoods and offering alternatives to poaching. We also provide tools to reduce conflict with wildlife.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: SAVING COASTAL FORESTS

WWF seeks to halt the illegal logging in Mozambique and Tanzania that is destroying vital coastal forests. We collaborate with authorities on a comprehensive investigation of illegal practices in an effort to create new policies and standards that mandate sustainable forest management and trade.

Aiming to reduce illegal activities, WWF helped the governments of Tanzania and Mozambique agree to work cooperatively on improving forest management. This benefits local people who rely on the forest for their livelihoods and frees up resources for the governments to improve local education and health infrastructure.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: COMBATING ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE

WWF supports the rangers who patrol protected areas in Tanzania and Mozambique. We facilitate ranger training and provide equipment. Outside of protected areas, WWF supports joint antipoaching efforts, involving police, military and park service staff. These campaigns have led to arrests of poachers and seizures of weapons and illegal wildlife items, including ivory and rhino horn. Joint operations have also improved the collaboration among different law enforcement institutions. WWF continues to support law enforcement and promote awareness of illegal wildlife trade.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE

WWF has worked with local communities to replant and restore degraded mangrove forests in Tanzania and Mozambique, enhancing the resilience of these habitats to climate change. The different types of mangroves that were planted can withstand longer periods of flooding. At the same time, inland areas were restored, enabling mangroves to adapt to sea level rise.

WWF works with communities to identify vulnerabilities to climate change, and help them develop strategies to adapt and increase their resilience. For example, we work with farmers to adopt drought resistant crops and conserve natural resources in the face of water shortages.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING MARINE TURTLES

The islands of Primeiras and Segundas off the coast of Mozambique are a major nesting site for several marine turtle species. WWF, in partnership with CARE, has worked to train local rangers to patrol nesting sites along these islands and marine turtle poaching has decreased significantly. We also work with local communities in Mozambique and Kenya to reduce turtle harvesting and local trade. Because exploitation of turtles is often driven by a lack of economic choices, WWF works to develop alternative livelihoods so that local people are no longer dependent on turtle products for income.

WWF encourages the use of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in shrimp trawlers, which allow marine turtles to escape from nets. In Mozambique, WWF helped initiate a new law that makes TEDs mandatory in the country’s shrimp trawl fleet. Once implemented, the law will save the lives of up to 5,000 marine turtles per year and allow Mozambican fishers to sell their shrimp to the U.S. market.

## %In response to Covid-19, a new partnership will boost the devastated nature-based tourism industry in Africa

The African Nature-Based Tourism Platform worked with partners in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe to conduct surveys assessing the impact of COVID-19 on communities and small to medium enterprises (SMEs) within the nature-based tourism sector. To date, the Platform has conducted 687 surveys across its 11 target countries. Leveraging this survey data, the Platform has collaborated with partners to develop community-led and designed grant proposals. In response to key challenges identified through this data, the Platform has assisted in mobilizing the following funding:

- In Malawi, a $186,000 grant from IUCN BIOPAMA is supporting climate-resilient alternative livelihoods near Kasungu National Park.
- In South Africa, a $14,000 grant from the South Africa National Lotteries Commission to help promote indigenous craft development for communities near Kruger National Park.
- In Botswana, an $87,000 grant from the Permanent Okavango River Basin Water Commission (OKACOM) is addressing food and water security for farmers near the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park
- In Zimbabwe, $135,000 in funding is improving community resilience to climate change in the Binga and Tsholotsho districts.
- In Namibia, $159,000 is supporting climate adaptation projects near Bwabwata National Park and surrounding conservancies.
- In Kenya, a $208,000 grant from IUCN BIOPAMA is addressing governance challenges in Lumo Community Conservancy.
- In Tanzania, a grant of $1.4 million from the European Union is addressing governance issues in 12 community-owned Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs).

The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic seem to reach nearly every part of the economy, and nature-based tourism in Africa is no exception. Closed borders, grounded flights, and restricted movement have slammed this industry, leaving businesses, communities, and individuals without crucial incomes. And a loss in tourism bookings means a loss of funding for communities’ conservation efforts. This, of course, comes on top of existing stressors that have already stretched conservation budgets thin, such as climate change, habitat loss and degradation, poverty, and illegal wildlife trade.

An urgent and collaborative solution is key to keeping nature-based tourism afloat and helping the people and wildlife that benefit from it.

With $1.9 million in funding from the Global Environment Facility, an African Nature-Based Tourism Collaborative Platform is being developed to connect funders to communities and small and medium enterprises involved in nature-based tourism in eastern and southern Africa—and who are most affected by the loss of revenue due to Covid-19. The platform will serve as a tool to gather data on the impacts of the pandemic, allow people to share knowledge, help with the development of funding proposals from communities and businesses, and make those proposals available to donors. WWF will serve as the GEF implementing and executing agency, as well as host the platform.

“I’m so excited about this platform because it addresses such a critical problem, and prioritizes the needs of the most marginalized communities,” said Nikhil Advani, director for climate, communities, and wildlife at WWF. “Working with a range of partners, including national Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) networks, NGOs, government agencies and the private sector, we’ll be taking a bottom-up approach, working with communities and small and medium enterprises to identify their needs, and connecting them with donors.”

Africa is home to some of the world’s most treasured biodiversity hotspots and the world’s most diverse and abundant large mammal populations, making it a hotspot for nature-based tourism. And many countries have worked hard to protect millions of acres of crucial habitat. However, managing those areas effectively is costly and requires a steady stream of funding. Nature-based tourism gives communities and governments a financial reason to continue to protect these special animals and places because it brings in revenue for wildlife authorities, local economies, communities, and national governments. Tourism revenue also goes into critical conservation operations, such as poaching reduction, wildlife monitoring, endangered species protection, and, often, local community benefit sharing programs.

Unfortunately, Covid-19 decimated this vital revenue stream. According to a recently published report, tourism contributed $194.2 billion or 8.5% to Africa’s GDP in 2018. And even when restrictions eventually lift, the path forward for nature-based tourism remains lengthy and unpredictable.

The impact this has on people and communities is dire. The jobs and revenue stemming from nature-based tourism provide livelihoods for millions of rural people and create incentives for protecting wildlife and wild places. With this revenue source all but dried up, many are left with limited streams of income and face extreme hardship.

This new platform will help these communities by functioning as a matchmaker between donors and people and businesses in need, resulting in the growth and well-targeted distribution of Covid-19 emergency relief funds, stimulus packages, and other financial support.

“An African community with a united voice stands a far greater chance of elevating this issue in the global agenda, amongst the many competing demands of the pandemic,” Advani said. “The platform will strive to achieve this through strong collaboration and by elevating the voices of those most in need to build back better for people, the economy, and conservation in Africa. “

While the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated impacts will be felt for some time to come, the data gathered through this platform, the emergency relief funding secured, and the longer-term efforts to build the resilience of the nature-based tourism sector will benefit communities and nature in Africa well beyond the crisis.

## %Protecting the habitats of lesser flamingos in East Africa

GREAT RIFT VALLEY :: EAST AFRICA

When conditions are right, some of the lakes in East Africa’s Great Rift Valley turn pink.

Millions of lesser flamingos—known for their light pink plumage and long necks—gather in saline and semisaline lakes such as Bogoria and Naivasha in Kenya and Natron in Tanzania. They arrive with two main items on their agenda: to consume blue-green algae and to breed.

The presence of volcanic minerals in the lakes creates the right kind of salinity for blue-green algae to bloom and nourish the leggy birds, and it's the red-orange pigment hidden in the algae that infuses their feathers with pink. 

But this seemingly ideal setting is being disrupted, and lesser flamingo populations have been decreasing. Human activities,  in the forms of wastewater pollution, mining, and inappropriate types of agriculture, threaten the health of the lakes. Excessive freshwater flowing into the lakes can make the algae disappear, and high nutrient levels can lead to excess algae bloom, which removes oxygen from the lakes.

The birds benefit when the integrity of their preferred lake habitats is protected. In the Lake Naivasha Basin, WWF-Kenya is using an integrated approach to tackle water challenges and further conserve the lake. And a WWF conservation initiative in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania—which aims to protect forests and wildlife habitats, conserve freshwater, and promote climate-smart agriculture—will likewise help protect Lake Natron.

## %Communities come together to restore mangroves

Mangroves protect and stabilize coastlines – particularly important as climate change brings more extreme storms and increased wave action. They also act as sinks, sequestering 3–5 percent more carbon per unit area than any other forest system. But mangroves are disappearing, cleared for urban and tourism development or felled for fuel and building materials.

Wise use of mangroves, such as creating coastal reserves and helping local communities develop livelihoods built on keeping them intact, is crucial for nature and people.

The most extensive mangrove cover, about a million hectares bordering the Western Indian Ocean, is found in the river deltas of Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania. As an ecozone between land and sea, mangroves are home to a huge variety of creatures, from birds and land mammals to dugongs, five marine turtle species and many kinds of fish. And much of the economically important prawn harvest along this coast depends on mangroves for safe spawning and nursery grounds.

In the Melaky region on Madagascar’s west coast, local people are taking action to remedy the loss of mangroves, which are crucial to their livelihoods. Since September 2015, men, women and children from the village of Manombo have become key players in mangrove conservation and restoration.

Mangrove restoration benefits local communities by improving access to fish and crab stock, which provide a regular income, and builds resilience against climate change. The village community participated in a reforestation campaign, planting around 9,000 mangrove seedlings to restore degraded forests around their village. Next to Manombo, other communities have together planted 49,000 seedlings. For the local communities and the future of their forests, that equals a real success.

## %Can we feed the world and protect the planet?

When Michael Fredericksen was in the Peace Corps in Tanzania about 20 years ago, the Great Ruaha River and the surrounding wetlands teemed with diverse wildlife and abundant water year-round. I met him on a recent trip to eastern Africa, where he still lives and works. Michael explained that deforestation, climate change, agriculture and hydroelectric dams have taken their toll on the region.

Wetland communities in neighboring Zambia also suffer under the weight of competing demands for water and other natural resources. There, I met with Wilfred Moonga, a passionate park warden and wildlife advocate at Lochinvar National Park. Wilfred explained how wildlife, native cattle farmers, migrant fishers, large sugar plantations and increasing hydropower demand are vying for resources.

Colleagues from World Wildlife Fund and CARE accompanied me on these trips as part of our Alliance, which promotes just and sustainable food systems. Building on a seven year-old pilot program in Mozambique, the Alliance is now exploring opportunities to advance environmentally, socially and economically sustainable food production systems in Tanzania and Zambia.

About 44 percent of Tanzanians and 74 percent of Zambians are living on US$1.25 a day or less. Most of them rely on agriculture to feed their families and generate income. According to the World Bank, “growth in agriculture is on average at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth outside agriculture.”

The CARE-WWF Alliance seeks to capitalize on this opportunity to address two concerns: the failure and inequities of existing food systems to meet the needs of a billion hungry people—particularly poor women and rural communities—and the negative impact that food production can have on our environment.

The Alliance has shown the transformative impact of integrated approaches through our work in coastal Mozambique for the last seven years. In the region of Primeiras e Segundas, farmers now institute conservation agriculture practices that have measurably improved soil health and water retention and led to a quadrupling of crop yields. The Alliance has also worked with communities to establish “no take” zones in key areas so depleted fish stocks can rebound. Within two years, the diversity of fish species inside these sanctuaries was 45% to 93% higher than outside of them. Fishers report that there were more fish and that the fish were larger than before. The Alliance also helped local farmers and fishers tap into larger markets and establish local savings and loan associations, which expanded opportunities for economic development. It is now empowering more than 40 community-based groups to improve their fishing and farming livelihoods by sustainably managing natural resources. These lessons learned in Mozambique can be applied in Zambia, Tanzania and elsewhere.

Protecting the environment, earning a living, and feeding the hungry are not mutually exclusive objectives. Indeed, we will not survive as a species if they are. Governments, businesses, NGOs and individuals must work together to achieve these goals.

These steps are among the most difficult, but we are taking them. Promoting just and sustainable food systems is no small vision, but it is achievable.

## %Can protecting fish and improving farms ease the food crisis in Mozambique?

Primeiras e Segundas, a coastal land and seascape in northern Mozambique, is one of the poorest regions in one of the world’s poorest countries. Lack of food security affects a third of all households, and most people pursue a mix of strategies to feed their families and make ends meet. For example, more than 80% of households that fish also farm.

The CARE-WWF Alliance is taking a twofold approach to helping communities bolster fisheries and increase the crop yield on family farms. The first step is helping people create no-take fishing zones that allow juvenile fish the chance to grow, reproduce, populate reefs and be available later in their life cycle as a food source. The second step includes working with farmers to fine-tune farming practices that improve soils and plant more pest-resistant varieties to increase harvest.

But does it work? Our research suggests it does. After two years, conservation agriculture practices are improving soil stability 30-40% and increasing rainfall infiltration rates (meaning more moisture stays in the soil) when compared with traditional farming practices. And the diversity of fish species inside no-take zones is proving to be 45-93% higher than outside those areas.

But what’s most exciting is the connection between the two: If WWF-CARE and communities can refine farming practices so that they are more stable, then we will alleviate much of the unsustainable pressure on fisheries as well, and families will have more food.
