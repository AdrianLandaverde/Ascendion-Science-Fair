# %CORAL TRIANGLE

The Coral Triangle is a marine area located in the western Pacific Ocean. It includes the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and Solomon Islands. Named for its staggering number of corals (nearly 600 different species of reef-building corals alone), the region nurtures six of the world’s seven marine turtle species and more than 2000 species of reef fish. The Coral Triangle also supports large populations of commercially important tuna, fueling a multi-billion dollar global tuna industry. Over 120 million people live in the Coral Triangle and rely on its coral reefs for food, income and protection from storms.

Current levels and methods of harvesting fish and other resources are not sustainable and place this important marine area and its people in jeopardy. A changing climate threatens coastal communities and imperils fragile reefs. The challenge ahead is to develop sustainable solutions for the Coral Triangle’s inhabitants and protect one of the most diverse marine habitats on Earth at the same time. Together with conservation partners and the governments of the region, WWF works to safeguard this important region for its people and the world.

CONTINENT: Asia
SPECIES: Whales, Tuna, Dugong, Humphead wrasse, Marine turtles

## %SPECIES

The Coral Triangle hosts an astonishing amount of marine life. Seventy-five percent of the world’s coral species are found here—nearly 600 different species. Over 2000 different types of reef fish find refuge in these dazzling underwater gardens, and this is an important place for tuna to spawn. Whales, dolphins, porpoises, dugongs and whale sharks feed, breed and migrate in these waters. And the Coral Triangle is home to six of the world’s seven species of marine turtles.

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

Coral Triangle marine resources support the livelihoods of over 120 million people and provide food to local coastal communities and millions more worldwide. The region also holds incredible cultural diversity. There are over 2,000 languages spoken across these waters and cultures share a strong connection to the sea.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

WWF works with communities in the Coral Triangle to understand and plan for climate change impacts. In Papua New Guinea, WWF has started mangrove nurseries, which help protect coastlines from impacts such as sea level rise. In Solomon Islands, WWF helped a community produce a film about preparing for climate change. The film documents current scenarios and captures traditional knowledge to help create ways to adapt to climate change.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: IMPROVING LIVELIHOODS

Donsol Bay, Philippines, attracts huge numbers of whale sharks, and locals benefit from the booming tourism industry. With WWF’s support, whale shark tourism creates jobs and provides a steady source of income for the community. In Solomon Islands, WWF helps a local community group operate a successful ecotourism venture adjacent to their own marine protected area.

WWF supports local partners who monitor and patrol marine protected areas and turtle nesting beaches. This monitoring allows local residents to benefit from the protection of these endangered species. We also support other sustainable sources of income, such as producing local handicrafts.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: SUPPORTING LOCAL CONSERVATION

In Solomon Islands, WWF supports the Tetepare Descendants Association (TDA), a group of local islanders that ensure the future of their livelihoods by sustainably managing their marine and land resources. WWF helps TDA manage its own marine reserve to monitor the reefs, patrol no take zones, collect data on endangered turtles and ensure their nests are protected.

## %THREATS

Overfishing, destructive fishing methods and nonselective fishing gear harm fragile reefs and devastate fish and other marine animal populations. A growing population and the effects of climate change also threaten the Coral Triangle.

The main threats are:

- DESTRUCTIVE FISHING
- BYCATCH
- CLIMATE CHANGE
- OVERFISHING

### %THREATS: DESTRUCTIVE FISHING

Destructive fishing methods, such as cyanide poisoning and dynamite fishing, are still widely practiced. Blasting destroys over 200 square feet of coral reef at a time, which leaves behind empty craters devoid of life. The practice devastates reefs and kills animals that live around them. Cyanide stuns fish without killing them, leaving them unable to move and easy to catch in a net or even by hand. As a result, fish populations and the local communities whose livelihoods and health depend on the fish are negatively impacted.

### %THREATS: BYCATCH

Every year millions of pounds of non-target fish species are caught in gillnets, on longlines and in trawls, and then discarded back into the sea. Whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds and marine turtles are often accidentally caught and suffer as well. In the Coral Triangle, the impacts of such bycatch are devastating, particularly to endangered marine turtles and sharks, and juvenile fish. Fishing gear is not selective in what it catches and there is a lack of management and policy to adequately address the issue.

### %THREATS: CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate change affects coastal ecosystems in the Coral Triangle through warming, rising seas and ocean acidification. Widespread coral reef bleaching, sea level rise and seawater acidification endanger marine animals like reef fish and marine turtles, negatively impact local livelihoods such as fishing and tourism, and threaten a critical supply of protein for more than one hundred million people.

Reef-building corals cannot survive if the water keeps warming. Corals rely on algae living inside them to supply them with food. These algae, which create the brilliant colors of healthy coral, die if the water gets too hot. The loss of the algae leaves the coral with a bleached appearance and leads to starvation.

Not only are ocean waters warming, but they also absorb more carbon dioxide (CO2)—a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. CO2 alters the ocean’s pH balance, which makes it more acidic and toxic to some marine organisms. Shellfish and corals are extremely vulnerable to ocean acidification because it interferes with their ability to form hard skeletons. Climate change also causes sea levels to rise—a big threat to coastal communities in the Coral Triangle, as well as to beach-dependent species such as marine turtles.

### %THREATS: OVERFISHING

Fishing is an essential source of income and food for the people that live in the Coral Triangle. However, fish are being depleted beyond levels from which populations can recover or the reef can sustain. Global demand for tuna drives the fishing industry to harvest at unsustainable levels and has led to an alarming decline of tuna stocks in the Coral Triangle. Grouper and snapper—essential to Asia’s booming live reef fish trade—are being depleted as well.

Live reef fish have long been traded around Southeast Asia as a luxury food item, but in recent decades such trade has expanded rapidly. As much as 50% of reef fish are taken from the water before they have had an opportunity to reproduce, which has serious consequences on the marine environment.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

They are:

- PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE
- CREATING PROTECTED AREAS
- PROTECTING MARINE TURTLES
- REDUCING BYCATCH
- BUILDING SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

Mangroves are trees and shrubs that grow in coastal areas. They protect shorelines in the Coral Triangle from storm surges and erosion, which are essential in the face of future climate change impacts. WWF supports mangrove reforestation in many areas to reduce coastal communities’ vulnerability to climate change impacts. There are other added benefits as well. For example, mangrove nurseries provide income to local communities in Papua New Guinea. The replanted mangroves in the Philippines have led to the return of juvenile fish and crab species, improved water quality, and increased wildlife populations.

WWF also works to protect marine areas from overfishing and other stresses so that they have a better chance of recovering from climate change impacts such as coral bleaching. Some fish can actually help coral reefs recover after damage from bleaching events. As corals try to rebuild, they compete for space with seaweed. Colorful parrotfish graze on seaweed, which gives corals more room to grow and repopulate. The humphead wrasse also helps coral reefs recover; these enormous fish feed on crown-of-thorn starfish, which eat corals.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CREATING PROTECTED AREAS

WWF works to create a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Coral Triangle. MPAs protect coral reefs and sea grass beds from destructive fishing practices and other unsustainable activities. They also allow damaged areas to recover, which is important for resilience against climate change. Protected areas allow fish to reproduce and grow to their adult size. This enables depleted fish populations to recover and increases fish catches in surrounding fishing waters. They provide refuge for other marine species too, such as endangered marine turtles and dugongs. WWF works to ensure protected areas are designed and managed well. We monitor fish spawning areas and the health of coral reefs, and study the impacts of protected areas on local communities.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING MARINE TURTLES

WWF works to protect turtle nesting beaches and supports the monitoring of nest sites by local rangers. We create local awareness of the threats marine turtles face and work with local communities to reduce turtle harvesting and local trade. Exploitation of turtles is often driven by a lack of economic choices. WWF works to develop alternative livelihoods so that local people are no longer dependent on turtle products for income. We also work to reduce bycatch of turtles in fishing gear through promotion of “circle” hooks and turtle excluder devices in nets.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: REDUCING BYCATCH

To reduce bycatch—the accidental capture of non-target marine animals in fishing gear—WWF promotes the use of alternative fishing hooks (“circle” hooks) and advocates for the use of special devices that exclude turtles from fishing nets. So far, WWF is having great results testing circle hooks in Papua New Guinea. Bycatch has been reduced and fishermen find the new hooks perform better than traditional hooks. We also aim to secure stronger policies and regulations on bycatch throughout the Coral Triangle so that alternative fishing gear can become standard practice across the region.

We run an international competition called Smart Gear to attract creative new ways to solve bycatch problems and to advance those ideas. Winning devices have been designed to minimize the bycatch of turtles on tuna longlines and help turtles avoid gillnets. We also work with fishermen to help them save turtles caught in fishing gear.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: BUILDING SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES

WWF works to create sustainable reef fish and tuna fisheries, and help them achieve certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). We also strengthen fishing regulations and compliance and improve fishery management plans through collaboration with the private sector and governments. For example, through the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) we work with scientists and companies that sell tuna to protect the Coral Triangle’s tuna stocks and reduce bycatch. We also promote increased production of reef fish from sustainable aquaculture sources (fish raised in farms) to ease the strain on endangered wild stocks.

## %Communities, coastlines, and conservation

Our oceans provide food, regulate Earth’s climate, and are rooted in cultural traditions and community livelihoods around the world. When we work on ocean conservation, we are inherently also working with people dependent on the ocean, particularly those who live along coastlines.

At WWF, I specialize in area-based management of coastal ecosystems and community-based conservation across east Africa, Asia, and Oceania. All regions that are rich in marine biodiversity and heritage.

Starting in 2012, I began working with local scientists in Indonesia to study the effectiveness of community-centric marine protected area’s (MPAs) in the Bird’s Head and Sunda Banda Seascape. MPAs are specific sections of ocean and coastline where fishing or resource gathering is banned. Having sanctuaries for wildlife to live without direct human extraction can allow wildlife populations to remain stable. MPA’s don’t have physical barriers, so wildlife are not restricted to stay within an MPA and communities can fish or extract any resources that move outside the coordinates of the protected area.

To study the sustainability success of MPAs, we support monitoring programs to assess ecosystem health and changes in local communities, providing dashboards that give scientists and managers a way to track progress towards conservation outcomes. This also helps us better understand what leads to conservation success in MPAs. In the Bird’s Head seascape, we found that when communities were more engaged and involved in their local protected area, there were also more fish and community food-security significantly improved. Both of these positive outcomes helped meet our goals of helping communities and ecosystems.

Although Marine Protected Areas are the most commonly applied ocean conservation approach, not all are delivering on their promises to protect wildlife. Many are either underfunded or are ‘paper parks’ – meaning conservation protections were declared by the government but very little regulations are in place to enforce them. To better track true MPA progress globally, I collaborated with leading experts and other conservation organizations to develop a MPA guide that provides clarity on both the role of protected areas and how countries can report their steps towards full implementation more accurately.

Over the course of my career, it’s been clear that to achieve success in nature conservation work, we must continue to learn and build upon available science knowledge. But to fully address the complexity of conservation, we increasingly need to draw upon interdisciplinary approaches, particularly the social sciences that engage the communities whose lives and livelihoods could be highly impacted by nature loss. Interdisciplinary work helps us build better, more equitable projects that put people central to conservation solutions and outcomes.

## %COASTAL COMMUNITY HEROES

Overfishing, pollution, coral bleaching, climate change—the threats facing our ocean are daunting. But there are stories full of hope from coastal communities, the stewards of the ocean whose livelihoods depend on its health. Working to protect these natural resources and improve their livelihoods with the help of WWF, they are the heroes of the sea. Six of these ocean witnesses tell us why they are so committed to the sea and what it has brought to their lives.

### %COASTAL COMMUNITY HEROES: Ernestine Perline - Dedicated communicator

Ernestine Perline is a mother of four and president of the fishers’ association of Marohata in southwest Madagascar. With the support of WWF, Ernestine introduced sustainable fishing practices in her community. But the road to get there was rocky: in 2013 a number of fishermen started using illegal fishing methods and fish stocks suddenly decreased drastically. 

“We lived from day to day,” says Ernestine. Around 60 kilos of catch a day turned into 20 and the role of President became a challenge. “Mobilizing community members to make our fisheries more sustainable has not been easy. The biggest challenge was creating an understanding of why marine resources must be handled sustainably.” 

In the end, Ernestine stopped the negative trend with patience and conversations on the importance of marine sustainability not only for the environment but for sustaining livelihoods that depend on healthy fish stocks. Today, fishing in their region is sustainable; destructive practices were given up and stocks are slowly recovering.

### %COASTAL COMMUNITY HEROES: Helena Lešić - Sharing her life's passion

In Croatia, Helena Lešić's story is a love story: To the sea, to fishing, and to her husband, Ivica. “The sea is our income and our life,” Ivica says. “This is where I was born, where I am raising my family, and where I will die.” For years Helena and Ivica lived solely from the sea but, over time, fish populations declined and their income dried up, so they turned to tourism with help from WWF. “By demonstrating our way of fishing to tourists we share a piece of our lives,” Helena says. 

Today the demand for their tours is so high that they don’t have to just rely on fishing to support their family. At each tour’s end, the catch of the day is cooked up right on the boat—as fresh as it gets.

### %COASTAL COMMUNITY HEROES: Patricio Merino - Unexpected visionary

Patricio Merino has lived on the Chilean island Raúl Marín Balmaceda since he was 13 and has worked in fisheries for years. “25 years ago, nobody thought about conservation issues and the only thing that mattered was catching as many fish as possible,” he says. But deep down, Patricio knew that fishing grounds weren’t infinite.

Over the years as he fished around the island, he grew particularly fond of Pitipalena-Añihué, an area off the coast where fjords, rivers, and ocean ecosystems melt together, making it ecologically rich with whales, dolphins, and sea birds. He knew that in order to both protect these natural wonders and preserve the fishing industry itself, fishers needed to come together to prioritize conservation. “In 2011 we started organizing meetings: the beginning of a long but successful participatory process,” he says. Today Patricio is Director of the Pitipalena-Añihué Foundation, the region's first community-managed marine protected area. “Without realizing it, we were visionaries.” Now he envisages many more protected areas across Chile’s extensive coast.

### %COASTAL COMMUNITY HEROES: Dhaval

Dhaval grew up in Porbandar, a coastal town in Gujarat, India. “Fishing has been the main livelihood and the ocean has always played a central role in the lives of the people in my community—it is even considered sacred,” he says. Influenced by the changes he has seen in the ocean, how his community is impacted by these changes and how their practices, in turn, impact the ocean, Dhaval took up fisheries science at university, focusing on sustainable fishing. 

Today he works with WWF on tackling shark bycatch in trawl nets. Shark bycatch is common with around 160 shark and ray species found along the region’s coast. To mitigate this problem, Dhaval is testing nets that would allow juvenile sharks to escape and hopes to introduce these nets in other regions.

### %COASTAL COMMUNITY HEROES: Jack Sagumai - Educating future conservationists

Jack Sagumai’s goal in life is to restore the health of the ocean. He grew up in a coastal community in Papua New Guinea and studied marine biology. “We rely on seafood, especially fish is a main ingredient of our diet,” he says. “The ocean also brings us seeds that grow into new trees and provide logs that serve as firewood or timber to build houses.” 

Papua New Guinea is part of the species-rich Coral Triangle and Jack wants to preserve its great biodiversity. He works with WWF and his community to collect data on sharks and rays and wants to teach his people the importance and process of fishing sustainably. “People talk about leaving a better planet for our children, but we need to leave better-informed children for our planet,” he says.

### %COASTAL COMMUNITY HEROES: Roziah Jalalid

Roziah Jalalid grew up on Omadal off the coast of Borneo. The Malaysian island is considered a natural paradise, but Roziah has seen the ocean deteriorate in recent years. “The weather is getting hotter, fish are getting lesser and pollution has gotten worse,” she says. She has noticed the island’s turtle populations impacted as well. “Five years ago, we found 14 turtle nests. This year, there are only four.” The increase in temperature results in more female than male turtle hatchlings being born and this imbalance makes mating difficult, threatening the population. 

Roziah knew this couldn't continue and decided to lead a change. She took over responsibility for the local women's association and got the group involved in protecting marine resources, including the turtles. These women now protect turtle nests and teach younger generations about the importance of conserving your environment. “Through the community, we educate kids and the next generation how to protect the sea.”

## %DEPTHS UNKNOWN

As the Bai Ni Takali pulls away from the small city of Lautoka, on Fiji’s largest island of Viti Levu, it cuts through water the profoundest shade of blue. Most days, the boat (whose name means “protecting the ocean” in Fijian) carries supplies on behalf of the government to remote islands within Fiji. But on this September morning, it sets out on a singular mission: The 14 researchers onboard will survey the Great Sea Reef, the third largest barrier reef system in the world.

The 162-mile-long reef, which snakes through the Pacific Ocean to the northwest of the island nation, has been studied much less than the larger and more famous barrier reefs of Australia and Central America. It was last surveyed in 2004, when researchers from WWF-Pacific explored its northern stretches. Now, WWF and Fiji’s Ministry of Fisheries, with support from the University of the South Pacific, have put together a team of divers to survey the entire reef system over the course of 20 days.

As the boat makes its way toward the first survey location on the southern end of the reef, marine scientist Dominic Andradi-Brown from WWF-US, Tomasi Tikoibua from the university, and Apolosi Cokanasiga from the fisheries ministry consult on the day’s dives, preparing dive sheets, checking GPS coordinates, and studying maps.

The Great Sea Reef, a priority for WWF’s Global Coral Reef Rescue Initiative—which focuses on climate resilient reefs and communities that depend on them—harbors around 40% of the known marine flora and fauna in Fiji and supplies as much as 80% of the fish caught for the domestic fisheries industry. But this important ecosystem faces threats from overfishing, climate change, and pollution from unsustainable agriculture and other land-based activities.

Supported by funders including The Henry Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, WWF is aiding the Fijian government and local communities in their efforts to establish a network of marine protected areas that will cover 30% of the country’s waters by 2030.

The Great Sea Reef survey will inform this work.

### %DEPTHS UNKNOWN: Deep dive

When the Bai Ni Takali reaches the first survey location about five hours later, local fishers, who are intimately familiar with the reef, ferry the researchers to the dive sites in skiffs. Pumice rafts—floating volcanic rock produced by the eruption of an underwater volcano—surround them. The sky is blindingly blue, but it sounds like a torrential rainstorm as the boats collide with small pumice stones on the water’s surface.

It’s the first of the day’s three dives, and the visibility is good. Over the course of the next hour, researchers observe the general health of the ecosystem and document three critical parts of the reef: seabed (coral, algae, sponges), fish, and invertebrates (such as sea cucumbers, giant clams, and crown-of-thorns starfish). Recording data on underwater slates, they focus on species that are ecologically and economically important.

Plant-eating fish, for example, play an important role in maintaining the balance between algae and corals. The fish have little market value but are eaten locally. Larger fish, such as grouper and snapper, are highly desirable at market, and are often sold to support community livelihoods. Sea cucumbers are collected and dried by villagers before being sold for export to Southeast Asia.

Back on the boat, findings are entered into a web-based tool called MERMAID (Marine Ecological Research Management Aid). “Each data collector has to enter their own data,” says Andradi-Brown. “Otherwise, there’s no way we would understand each other’s notes!” Developed by WWF and the Wildlife Conservation Society, MERMAID stores and “proofreads” the data, eliminating errors and inconsistencies and saving researchers valuable time.

### %DEPTHS UNKNOWN: Signs of trouble and hope

Several days later, researchers drop into the water on the outer barrier reef. Below, common whitetip reef sharks hug a wall of coral that plunges hundreds of feet into intense blue depths. Suddenly Andradi-Brown scribbles on his dive slate “large shark—not a reef shark,” and points down the edge of the wall. Seconds later, a mature bull shark, maybe 6 feet long, swims past, eyeing him. As the researchers start unspooling their transect tapes along the top of the reef, Andradi-Brown glances nervously over the edge of the wall, where the bull shark patrols below.

Shark attacks here are not unknown, and local fishers are at particular risk. They often fish at night, free diving and hand spearing their catches as they hold their breath for minutes at a time. It’s dangerous work.

WWF-Pacific community development officer Metui Tokece knows the dangers well. He grew up spearfishing around the islands. But what concerns him more today is the absence of the fish known as giant sweetlips. “We used to spear these at ankle depth,” he says. “But now we only see them at a depth of 10 meters.”

In Fiji, communities hold customary management rights to local fishing grounds called qoliqoli; it is their right to create protected areas or bar outsiders from fishing. But parts of the reef are commercially exploited for live reef fish, and illegal fishing has contributed to dwindling fish populations.

Tokece points to another troubling finding: silt on the reef near the coast. In many places on the islands, native forest has been cleared to make way for sugar cane and pine plantations. Unsustainable agricultural practices, such as planting up to the edge of rivers, mean rain washes soil downstream and into the ocean, where it settles as sediment on the reef and smothers corals.

Yet the researchers find signs of hope as well. There are no major outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, coral predators that can decimate reefs when their populations grow unchecked. And though there is some evidence of coral bleaching, the reef has not experienced the mass bleaching events that have destroyed corals elsewhere. “For bleaching to occur, you need a combination of high temperature and bright sunlight,” Andradi-Brown explains. “Fiji typically faces high temperatures during cyclone season, when it’s cloudy and stormy, which may have helped spare Fiji so far.”

### %DEPTHS UNKNOWN: Turtle guardians

Midway through the expedition, researchers visit a protected area on the island of Mali, where they meet Henry Koliniwai standing watch over the Mali qoliqoli from the vantage point of a guardhouse.

“We built this house in 2016 to stop people from outside of Mali Island from fishing here,” he says.

Today Koliniwai is a Dau ni Vonu—a guardian of turtles—but he was once a turtle hunter.

Fiji is home to five of the seven sea turtle species, and turtle meat is a traditional staple. Once consumed only at special events like weddings or funerals, the meat over time became a common food item, its consumption contributing to dwindling turtle populations. Today, turtle species here rate a place on the IUCN Red List, with the loggerhead listed as vulnerable and the hawksbill as critically endangered.

In 1995, the Fiji government imposed a temporary ban on turtle harvesting; in 2008, WWF successfully pushed for a 10-year moratorium, during which harvesting was allowed only by permit for special occasions.

Now, says WWF’s Tokece, the communities are the ones leading protection efforts.

Koliniwai says he does this work so his children and grandchildren can have turtles around them, and he’s happy to see the impact he and others are having. “Before, when my father and I went fishing, we saw very few turtles,” he says. “Now, we see a bit more.”

### %DEPTHS UNKNOWN: Building the future

Several evenings later, the crew and researchers sit in a circle on the boat’s lower back deck. As the sun sets, half a coconut shell filled with kava—a slightly sedative plant-based drink—is passed around. Each person claps once before receiving the shell and thrice after taking a sip. They reflect on what they’ve seen during the dives.

The expedition is nearing its end, and a few things seem clear to Andradi-Brown: Given the existence of the qoliqoli, the framework for implementing strong community conservation plans in Fiji already exists. And the survey, with its diagnosis of reef health, will provide the foundation for the hard work ahead.
