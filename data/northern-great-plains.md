# %NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS

The Northern Great Plains spans more than 180 million acres and crosses five U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. As large as California and Nevada combined, this short- and mixed-grass prairie is one of only four remaining intact temperate grasslands in the world.

Two hundred years ago bison, pronghorn, black-footed ferrets, and a diverse array of grassland birds thrived across the Northern Great Plains. While mapping and exploring the region, Lewis and Clark were awestruck, noting the "immence [sic] herds of Buffaloe [sic] deer Elk and Antelopes which we saw in every direction feeding on the hills and plains."

The diverse wildlife that roamed these vast grasslands are not lost. They still call this place home, but their calls are muted and tracks and nests less abundant. WWF is working to restore this living prairie in the heart of North America. At the crux of our vision is a mosaic of private, public and tribal lands managed in a manner that benefits wildlife and local communities. We work with the ranching community, public agencies, tribal nations and other conservation partners to ensure that the richness of the prairie ecosystem is sustained and enhanced for future generations to enjoy.

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

WWF is committed to identifying conservation solutions that bolster economic opportunities for the people and communities who call this region home. We recognize that conserving the Northern Great Plains goes hand-in-hand with sustaining the rural communities who live here. WWF supports grasslands and those who live here, identifying conservation solutions that help both thrive.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: RANCHING COMMUNITY

Most of the Northern Great Plains (NGP) ecoregion is comprised of private land (approximately 77%)—over 904 million acres of which remain as intact grassland. Some families in the region have been ranching their land for more than 150 years. Working with ranchers to conserve intact grasslands creates habitat for a broad diversity of birds and a suite of grassland wildlife species, mitigates run-off, increases water infiltration, and secures carbon in the soil.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES

Native Americans are this region's original land stewards. Today, tribes manage roughly 9 million acres of the Northern Great Plains ecoregion, much of which is rich in biodiversity and astoundingly beautiful. Most tribal communities in the Northern Great Plains see a unique cultural and spiritual significance to sustaining grasslands and restoring wildlife. WWF helps tribes achieve conservation success while improving the lives of their communities.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: CONSERVATION COMMUNITY

Growing concerns about the ongoing destruction of the Northern Great Plains has resulted in an expanding number of organizations and agencies joining in partnerships to coordinate their conservation work. WWF works closely with these interests through formal joint ventures, cooperatives, networks and smaller partnerships to scale up and magnify our conservation investments.

## %THREATS

The Northern Great Plains was shaped by change. Seasonal migrations of millions of bison kicking up dust and grass. Frigid winters, high winds and blistering summers. Spring rainstorms, intense dry lightening outbreaks and rampaging rivers or racing wildfires. But now modern changes threaten the wildlife and land in the Northern Great Plains.

The main threats are:

- GRASSLAND CONVERSION
- ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
- CLIMATE CHANGE
- HABITAT FRAGMENTATION

### %THREATS: GRASSLAND CONVERSION

Originally the region was a nearly continuous sea of rich grasses, watersheds and wildflowers. Today, demand for agricultural commodities and new, drought resistant bioengineered crops encourage the degradation of native grasslands, increasing incentives to till the land while draining waterways and watersheds. This plow-up of native grasslands will continue to reshape the landscape and push out wildlife if conservation is not considered.

### %THREATS: ENERGY DEVELOPMENT

Energy development pressure in the NGP comes from both traditional (oil, gas, and coal) and renewable (wind and solar) sources. Some of the nation's largest coal reserves exist in the region, and wind energy development is growing across every state in the NGP. Advances in oil and natural gas extraction allow industry to tap into parts of the region where resources were once too difficult and expensive to access.

### %THREATS: CLIMATE CHANGE

In the Northern Great Plains, WWF predicts erratic weather will result in more extreme levels of heat, snow and rain, severe floods and droughts. Land managers will need to change how they plan, implement, evaluate and carry forward their land use plans to make ends meet in the face of climate change. 

### %THREATS: HABITAT FRAGMENTATION

From seasonal migrations across state or country boundaries to moving between nesting and feeding grounds, wildlife need the freedom to roam for survival. Changes in land-use, roads, permanent fences, grassland conversion, and invasive plant species can restrict wildlife's ability to adapt, move, find mates and food, and thrive.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

WWF leads innovative work with public agencies, tribal nations, ranchers and other partners to create a sustainable future for the Northern Great Plains. Our two main goals are to sustain and enhance biodiversity across the Northern Great Plains and to restore two flagship species—bison and black-footed ferrets—where possible within the region. Achieving these goals requires a multi-pronged approach that recognizes unique challenges and opportunities from the local level all the way up to US federal policy and global initiatives. WWF is a leading voice for grasslands, and advocates for the incredible wildlife and communities of the Northern Great Plains.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: RANCHING AND CONSERVATION

WWF works with ranchers and communities to identify and implement conservation strategies that maintain grasslands and improve rural livelihoods. Ranchers in the NGP today face difficult choices in an increasingly complex environment, including changing crop technologies, financial pressures, diverse consumer dietary preferences, and uncertainty about future agricultural prices and markets. Even with the best intentions to maintain grassland productivity, tradeoffs and the financial bottom line are ever-present considerations. Thus, WWF’s conservation strategies work to address issues ranchers are facing that may impact grassland conservation.

The Sustainable Ranching Initiative, started in 2011, works with landowners, corporations, industry-groups, NGOs, and government agencies to: protect lands from grassland conversion, improve management on working lands, and restore cropland or degraded lands back to native grassland.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: TRIBAL PARTNERSHIPS

WWF partners with several tribal nations throughout the Northern Great Plains to restore species, improve capacity, and to build more sustainable financing for tribal wildlife programs. Many tribes are seeking to increase technical capacity to manage reservation lands for wildlife, an area where WWF is able to provide important support. WWF helps tribal nations in South Dakota and Montana to develop and implement comprehensive wildlife management plans. We bring technical and financial resources so tribal nations can retain biologists, enhance technical capabilities, and restore wildlife in a way that can manage at scale—especially tribal bison herds and populations of the highly endangered black-footed ferret.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PUBLIC LANDS CONSERVATION

Public lands contain some of the most iconic landscapes of the Northern Great Plains, including nearly 23 million acres of intact grassland. Yet, these lands face growing threats of disturbance as energy and other development encroaches. WWF works to ensure that public land management plans protect these vast areas that serve as vital habitat for species—such as sage grouse and mule deer—and comprise some of the best remaining habitat for declining grassland bird species, like the Sprague’s pipit. Many of these lands also provide crucial grazing resources for neighboring ranching communities. Through our public lands program, we continue to partner with leaders in public land management at the national and local levels, bringing influence and resources to bear so that these ecosystems are adequately protected.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: SCIENCE AND METRICS

WWF’s science team continually refines planning models used to focus and prioritize our conservation actions. Ecoregional and landscape-level progress is tracked toward our conservation goals in the Northern Great Plains. We use cutting-edge techniques to model species richness, assess future threats, and predict patterns of change across the region. WWF has been a science leader, engaging a variety of partners working in this region, and we continue to hold a high standard for designing smart strategy and updating planning as the world changes.

## %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat

Beavers, often regarded as nature's architects, are captivating subjects in conservation. They are so good at their jobs that experts have mimicked the blueprint of their dams to benefit river ecosystems. WWF supports projects from New Mexico to Montana and beyond that help save beaver populations and restore critical freshwater habitats. 

Learn more about these industrious creatures and their remarkable contributions to ecosystem restoration and water management:

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Ecosystem engineers

Beavers are renowned for their engineering prowess. With their sharp teeth and keen instincts, they construct elaborate dams and lodges that alter landscapes, creating wetland habitats vital for numerous plant and animal species. But the North American beaver population, which exceeded 100 million in the 1600s, has fallen to between 6 million and 12 million today. With fewer beaver dams, fewer streams in the western US are connected to their surrounding landscape.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Water stewards

Beavers play a crucial role in water conservation. Their dams help retain water in streams and rivers, mitigating floods during heavy rains and ensuring a steady water supply during dry periods.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Biodiversity boosters

Beaver ponds and their surrounding wetlands serve as biodiversity hotspots, supporting a wide array of wildlife. From fish and amphibians to waterfowl and mammals, these habitats provide food, shelter, and breeding grounds for numerous species.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Natural filtration systems

Beaver dams act as natural filtration systems, trapping sediment and pollutants, thereby improving water quality downstream. This filtration process helps to remove excess nutrients and contaminants, benefiting both aquatic ecosystems and communities.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Climate resilience

In 2022, WWF worked with numerous cattle ranchers in Montana to build beaver dam analogs—human-made structures that mimic a beaver dam’s capability to slow and hold water for longer periods on the landscape. WWF also works in the Rio Grande basin supporting multiple organizations—Rio Grande Return, Defenders of Wildlife, and Rio Grande Joint Venture—using these artificial dams as one part of ecosystem-sized restoration. By installing beaver dam analogs, communities can enhance resilience to climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, while promoting biodiversity and water conservation.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Adaptive engineering

Beaver dam analogs are versatile structures that can be tailored to suit various landscapes and hydrological conditions. Many ranchers partner with WWF to strategically construct them to slow water flow and increase their ranchland’s drought tolerance. Whether in mountain streams or urban waterways, beaver dam analogs offer a flexible and cost-effective approach to habitat restoration and water management.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Community engagement

Building beaver dam analogs fosters community engagement and stewardship. Through hands-on restoration projects and educational initiatives, communities can actively participate in conserving and restoring wetland habitats.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Cost-effective solutions

Compared to traditional engineering interventions, beaver dam analogs are often more cost-effective to install and maintain. By harnessing the natural processes of beavers, communities can achieve significant environmental benefits at a fraction of the cost.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Tourism and recreation

Restored wetlands created by beaver dam analogs attract tourists and outdoor enthusiasts, providing opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and wildlife photography. These recreational activities not only promote conservation awareness but also stimulate local economies.

### %How beaver dams—and human-made replicas—help save wildlife and restore freshwater habitat: Collaborative conservation

Successful implementation of beaver dam analogs requires collaboration among various people and entities, including landowners, conservation organizations, and government agencies. By working together, communities can leverage the collective expertise and resources needed to maximize the ecological benefits of artificial dams.

US beavers and beaver dam analogs exemplify the power of using nature to address conservation challenges. Through their ingenuity and adaptability, these remarkable creatures and their innovative counterparts offer hope for the restoration and preservation of ecosystems for future generations.

## %We’ve lost millions of acres of grasslands. Here’s how we can protect what’s left.

Grasslands are critical for people, nature, and the climate, yet we are plowing them up for cropland at an astounding, unsustainable rate. WWF's 2023 Plowprint Report shows that 1.6 million acres of grassland habitat were destroyed in the Great Plains across the US and Canada in 2021. Since 2012, we've lost 32 million acres, plowed up primarily for row crop agriculture.

Healthy grasslands are invaluable. They provide critical habitat for plants and wildlife, store vast amounts of carbon that help mitigate the climate crisis, provide livelihoods and food security to rural communities and Native Nations across the region, and support a vibrant ranching industry.

Good public policy is one of the best tools available to turn the tide of destruction in the Great Plains. We cannot afford to lose any more of this precious ecosystem; we have already lost 70% of America's prairies, and only 377 million acres remain across the Great Plains—much of which is privately owned and managed.

To reverse current trends, we must address the policies that are encouraging grassland plow-up, bolster investment in programs keeping them intact, and support sustainable, grass-based agriculture.

Important grassland-friendly policy actions:

1. Protect the historic investment in conservation programs included in the Inflation Reduction Act. The passing of this legislation directed $20 billion toward agricultural conservation and rural communities—the largest investment of its kind. 
2. Expand and strengthen a key program to eliminate subsidies for crop insurance on newly converted grasslands. Crop insurance subsidies reduce the risks associated with farming marginal lands such as converted grasslands, incentivizing crop expansion on those lands. Congress can address this by strengthening a key program in the Farm Bill called Sodsaver to eliminate these subsidies. 
3. Increase investment in Farm Bill conservation programs that can keep grasslands intact, healthy, and able to support vibrant economies and communities. The 2023-2024 Farm Bill provides a critical opportunity to invest in conserving grasslands, supporting sustainable grazing, enhancing wildlife habitat, and expanding programs that provide the financial and technical assistance that farmers and ranchers need to protect grasslands, such as the Grasslands Conservation Reserve Program, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and Conservation Stewardship Program.
4. Increase equity and access, including for Native Nations. Although Native Nations have an outsized impact on conservation, with 80% of Tribal lands remaining as intact grasslands, the Farm Bill should ensure the US Department of Agriculture consults with, and increases access to programs for historically marginalized communities, increasing opportunities for Native Nations to conserve and restore grasslands.
5. Reduce food loss and waste and keep existing productive farmland healthy, minimizing pressure to convert grasslands.
6. Pass the North American Grasslands Conservation Act, which would provide important support for grasslands and the communities that rely on them.
7. Address the unintended consequences of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Increased demand for biofuels crops such as corn and soybeans, combined with the lack of effective implementation of the original law's provisions to prevent biofuels-driven conversion, resulted in the program causing significant conversion of grasslands to cropland. We can address this by ensuring crops from lands converted to crop production since the creation of the RFS are not allowed to qualify for the program.

We must act now to maintain grassland systems for agriculture, wildlife habitat, and carbon sequestration, both for today and for future generations. Policy is a key lever we must pull to make this happen.

## %Native Nations lead the way to returning bison to their traditional homelands

It is difficult to overstate the immense ecological and cultural value of the plains bison to the lifeways and lands of Native Nations throughout the Northern Great Plains. In fact, many Plains People, including the Lakota, consider the bison their relatives.

At one point—prior to European colonization and the devastation it wrought—bison were the widest-ranging large mammal in North America, numbering between 30 million and 60 million. But by 1889, only 512 plains bison remained after the ravages of westward expansion, market demand, and a deliberate effort by the US Government to eliminate the species to subdue the Native people that relied so heavily upon them.

In response to their near extermination, conservationists—including Indigenous people—successfully brought the plains bison back from the brink of extinction to a population of approximately 45,000 in Tribal and conservation herds. Of those, 20,000 are managed in the public interest by governments and environmental organizations, and an estimated 25,000 are managed by Native Nations. 

Native Nations seeking to restore bison to their lands remain the cornerstone of the species’ recovery. Since 2014, WWF has partnered with Native Nations throughout the Northern Great Plains in support of their efforts to conserve and restore grassland ecosystems within their communities and stands behind local visions and strategies that aim to bolster ecological, economic, and community benefits. Our goal is to support bison restoration efforts that serve the expressed values, needs, and aspirations of the Native Nations with whom we work, which include the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes, Fort Belknap Indian Community, and the Sicangu Lakota Nation.

Moving forward, WWF will continue to follow the lead of Native Nations to identify opportunities and create places where bison can thrive in large herds—numbering over 1,000 bison—on vast landscapes in the Northern Great Plains.

### %Native Nations lead the way to returning bison to their traditional homelands: Sicangu Lakota Nation

The Sicangu Lakota Nation is on track to create the largest Native-owned and managed bison herd in North America—an impressive feat that honors Lakota foundational values and beliefs and the inseverable connection between the Buffalo People and this iconic species. In 2020, the nation committed 28,000 acres of native grassland on the lands of the Sicangu Lakota Nation, the Rosebud Reservation, in South Dakota, for the creation of the Wolakota Buffalo Range. This range has a capacity to support over 1,000 bison.

A partnership between Sicangu Co—the economic arm of the Sicangu Lakota Nation—and WWF is advancing the project with support from the Rosebud Tribal Land Enterprise, the Rosebud Sioux Tribes land management corporation, and the US Department of the Interior. The historic project will increase the overall number of Native American-owned bison by an impressive 7% nationally.

### %Native Nations lead the way to returning bison to their traditional homelands: Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes

WWF was invited by members of the Fort Peck community to work collaboratively to ensure that their Tribal bison herd contributes to the health and well-being of the community. Through this collaboration, WWF has supported the Pté Group, a community stakeholder group, and the Fort Peck Buffalo Program by funding an additional position until the Tribes were able to maintain the position long-term. WWF has also supported the development of new programs and activities including affordable meat sales, improvements to Fort Peck’s Yellowstone bison quarantine facility, and an online fish and game license sales system.

Since 2016, WWF has supported Fort Peck’s efforts to develop a four-mile Buffalo Connections Trail for visitors and community members. This exciting project will increase community access to the bison herd. The trail will feature art installations and interpretive signs that will encourage outdoor recreation, strengthen cultural connections, and deepen appreciation for Fort Peck’s lands and wildlife.

### %Native Nations lead the way to returning bison to their traditional homelands: Fort Belknap Indian Community

WWF has worked with Fort Belknap’s Buffalo Program to assess range carrying capacity, to advise on proposed bison range management scenarios, to support bison range expansion, and to facilitate the construction of wildlife-friendly bison fencing. WWF has supported a part-time position through a grant administered by Aaniiih Nakoda College to help with the buffalo program’s community outreach and engagement.

## %Nearly 1.8 million acres of grassland destroyed in US and Canada in 2020

Nearly 1.8 million acres of grasslands were destroyed across the US and Canadian Great Plains in 2020 alone, according to WWF’s seventh-annual Plowprint Report. Each year, the report analyzes plow-up that occurred two years prior to the report's release.

Since 2016, a total of almost 10 million acres have been plowed across the region, which is an area nearly as large as New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island combined.

“We rely on grasslands for pollinators, clean water, and healthy air,” said Martha Kauffman, VP of WWF’s Northern Great Plains Program. “When grassland habitats are plowed up, it puts all of us in jeopardy. But with the right policies, incentives, stewardship, and increased efficiencies, we can stop the destruction and even expand native grasslands, ensuring that they’ll be around for generations to come.”

Indeed, one of the best mechanisms we have for curbing the destruction of grasslands is policy. That is why this year’s report also features several policy-based opportunities and recommendations to help conserve more acres of grassland, including the recently introduced North American Grasslands Conservation Act (NAGCA) and the upcoming 2023 Farm Bill. Both policies offer incentives for voluntary landowner-driven conservation efforts that could result in positive impacts for years to come for the region’s rural communities and irreplaceable ecosystems.

Introduced in July 2022, NAGCA would provide new resources for voluntary, incentive-based conservation of grasslands and establish a strategy for the protection, restoration, and management of grassland ecosystems across North America. Modeled after the successful North American Wetlands Conservation Act, the Grasslands Act would provide voluntary technical and financial assistance to conserve our remaining grasslands, while contributing to climate resilience, rural livelihoods, and wildlife abundance.

The Farm Bill is among the most significant pieces of legislation for grassland ecosystems, providing the largest source of federal funding for private lands conservation and governing influential food and agriculture programs. With Congress preparing for reauthorization in 2023, the upcoming Farm Bill is a critical opportunity to strengthen and fund key programs that support healthy grasslands like the Conservation Reserve Program, provides financial support to farmers who take environmentally sensitive land out of crop production and establish beneficial ground cover, and Sodsaver, which helps disincentivize conversion of native sod by lowering crop insurance subsidies on cropland converted from native prairie.

## %Why we need The North American Grasslands Conservation Act

North America’s grasslands are some of the most threatened habitats on the planet. WWF’s 2021 Plowprint Report found that from 2018-2019 alone an estimated 2.6 million acres of grassland across the US and Canadian Great Plains were plowed-up, primarily to make way for row crop agriculture. To put this into context, an area greater than Yellowstone National Park was destroyed in a single year.

Our grasslands provide critical wildlife habitat, support rural economies, filter water, and keep carbon in the soil, serving as a buffer against climate change. They have been the home of Native American nations since time immemorial and have supported ranching families for the past several generations. Unfortunately, more than 70 percent of America’s tallgrass, mixed-grass, and shortgrass prairies have been lost, which has led to the precipitous decline of species including grassland birds and pollinators.

To protect and restore iconic grassland landscapes, World Wildlife Fund and more than a dozen of North America’s leading conservation groups are touting the introduction of critical new legislation—The North American Grasslands Conservation Act—which has been introduced by US Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), with support from Senators Michael Bennet ( Colorado) and Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota). If passed, the bill would become one of the most significant steps for grassland conservation in a generation. Senator Wyden and partners continue to seek co-sponsors.

“Grasslands matter because they provide irreplaceable habitat for species like the plains bison. They matter because they lock carbon in the ground. And they matter as a home for the Native nations and ranchers whose cultures and livelihoods are tied to the land,” said Carter Roberts, President and CEO of World Wildlife Fund. “Pressure to convert grasslands for agriculture or other uses contributed to the loss of some 2.6 million acres across the US and Canadian portions of the Great Plains from 2018-2019 alone.

This new legislation would create incentives to help reverse that trend, providing funding needed to restore and conserve America’s remaining grasslands. It will enable landowners and Native nations to ensure grasslands remain for future generations. WWF thanks Senators Wyden, Bennet, and Klobuchar for their leadership in introducing this landmark legislation.”

The Grasslands Act would help kickstart the voluntary protection and restoration of grasslands and sagebrush shrub-steppe ecosystems—and the livelihoods and wildlife that depend on them—by creating a landowner-driven, voluntary, incentive-based program to conserve these imperiled landscapes. It’s urgent that we maintain these ecosystems systems today, while continuing our support for the Native nations, ranchers, farmers, and rural communities who call them home.

## %BISON HELP TO RESTORE GRASSLANDS

Nature and the habitats it harbors are dynamic and always in flux. Change is a natural part of every ecosystem, and within the struggle for survival, no opportunity or advantage is wasted. If there is a resource to be had, some organism, whether plant, animal, or fungi will take advantage of it. The same holds true for grasslands, and without the balance provided by grazing animals, woody vegetation like trees and shrubs become more common, altering the landscape in ways that are less compatible for the species that once relied upon them.

For millennia, the grasslands of the Northern Great Plains were grazed and balanced by the actions of a multitude of wildlife species that included an estimated 30-60 million plains bison. While many of the species that were found historically across the Great Plains still roam here today, bison were intentionally driven to near extinction to subjugate Native people as colonists spread west. The decimation of this species not only impacted the Indigenous people but caused harm to the associated landscapes and species as well. With the erasure of bison, the land’s ability to sustain other wildlife, store water, and flourish was disrupted in ways that we’re still trying to understand and repair.

These days, cattle fill many of the ecological roles once held by bison, and WWF is proud to partner with ranchers who sustainably manage their herds in ways that are easier on the land. However, because bison evolved with North America’s grasslands, their behaviors and interactions with other species have a unique impact on the landscape not brought by other species. Their evolution carried their own ancestors, the steppe bison, which migrated from Asia across the Bering Strait, through the trials and tribulations that all newcomers face in a new land. Many of these trials are the same that non-Indigenous people have faced over the past century, as they have learned how to live in harmony with the landscapes of the Great Plains and beyond.

In 2020, after an absence of 140-years, bison once again roamed the prairie that is now the Wolakota Buffalo Range, located on the land of the Sicangu Lakota Oyate on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The Rosebud Economic Development Corporation (REDCO), with support from World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Rosebud Tribal Land Enterprise (TLE) welcomed the inaugural transfer and release of 100 plains bison (often called buffalo by Native people) from the National Park Service. Barely a year later, the number of bison on this 27,680-acre parcel of tribal land has risen to nearly 800 animals thanks to the hard work of REDCO’s staff and the support of a broad network of partners and donors.

Prior to the bison’s return to Wolakota, the land was primarily leased to non-tribal members for cattle management, and due to long-term overgrazing,  the grasslands on the range were highly degraded. The range lacked a healthy level of functional diversity within the plant community, with few deep-rooted, warm-season grasses and an overabundance of shallower-rooted, cool-season species and/or annual plants. In addition, plant vigor was reduced, meaning the plants were often stunted when fully grown. This was evident in the lower availability of forage and seed production. According to a forthcoming REDCO report on the state of the Wolakota Buffalo Range, while “the drought in 2021 certainly affected plant vigor, the lower than anticipated forage production figures were indicative of longer-running issues related to the history of grazing management in this area.” For example, when lands are grazed continuously and intensively, the plants do not have an opportunity to gather and store energy in their roots making it available for future growth and seed production.

“The ecological monitoring taking place at Wolakota allows those managing the land and the buffalo to gain a more intimate knowledge of the changes that are taking place as the bison are brought back and the herd grows,” stated Dennis Jorgensen, Bison Program Lead at WWF’s Northern Great Plains Program. “This understanding can be rooted in traditional knowledge and western science, and in both cases, it will contribute to charting a better path forward for the recovery of the Wolakota Buffalo Range and all the beings that call it home.”

The results are already showing signs of promise. In 2021, hardly a year after bison were reintroduced to the Wolakota range, signs of improvement were already appearing on the land. There were reductions in bare ground at several sites and improved ground cover—the native grassland plants were returning. Although the region continues to experience drought, the positive results suggest that there is more moisture in the soil than in previous years. In the years to come, grazing strategies designed to maximize days of growing season recovery between repeated grazing of individual plants will also contribute to ongoing improvements in plant and landscape health.

“We are going to ensure the buffalo are taken care of in a way that is culturally appropriate. Part of our instructions are to treat buffalo as buffalo. Don’t treat them like cattle,” said Clay Colombe CEO of REDCO. “That means we have to raise them differently from how a lot of people do buffalo ranching. We have to make sure they have big open spaces to use the land how they need to.”

In addition to typical Western rangeland monitoring, Wolakota is committed to utilizing Lakota traditional ecological knowledge to assess the health of the land. By working with knowledge keepers and medicine men, staff will track the presence of plants and animals that are of particular interest to the Lakota. “The Western metrics are great for measuring certain things,” said Colombe. “But, as Lakota, those things don’t really matter unless we are also preserving and strengthening our way of life.”

## %Eight species making a comeback

Species recovery is an essential part of any ecosystem's long-term resiliency and health. And there are some key species making a comeback and playing a pivotal role in their ecosystems.

Sumatra’s Thirty Hills is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth, where WWF has been focusing ecosystem restoration efforts for the past few years. A recent biodiversity monitoring survey in the region revealed many iconic species from tigers to Sumatran elephants, Sunda pangolins, Malayan tapirs, Sunda clouded leopards, and more, all of which are benefiting from conservation efforts.

Recovering species is essential for effective wildlife conservation and critical to the work WWF does around the world. Here are just a few of our favorite, recent recovery stories:

- Black-footed ferrets in the Northern Great Plains
- Black rhinos in Namibia
- Greater one-horned rhino in India
- Humpback whales in oceans
- Mountain gorillas in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo
- Snow leopards in Mongolia
- Swift foxes in Montana
- Tigers in Nepal

### %Eight species making a comeback: Black-footed ferrets in the Northern Great Plains

For the last 30 years, concerted efforts from many organizations have given black-footed ferrets
—one of North America’s most endangered mammals—a second chance for survival. Declines in the habitat of prairie dogs, the main prey species for black-footed ferrets, and non-native disease led to their extinction. Today, recovery efforts have helped restore black-footed ferrets to around 300 animals across North America; the goal is to reach 3,000. Their recovery in the wild signifies the health of the grassland ecosystem which they depend on to survive.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Black rhinos in Namibia

In March 2020, the southwestern black rhino, one of three black rhino subspecies, was reclassified from “vulnerable” to “near-threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) after its population increased more than 11%. This status change parallels a hopeful trend for all of Africa’s black rhinos. Although the species overall faces persistent threats from poaching and is still classified as critically endangered, its population has climbed steadily since 2012.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Greater one-horned rhino in India

In 2020, Manas National Park, located in the northeastern Indian state of Assam, saw a significant growth in its greater one-horned rhino population. Thanks to conservation efforts, such as rhino translocations, Manas is now home to 47 greater one-horned rhinos!


### %Eight species making a comeback: Humpback whales in oceans 

After significant efforts to reduce present-day threats of fisheries bycatch and ship collisions with wildlife, humpback whales have been on a steady road to recovery in several of the world’s oceans. In Australia alone, data shows that both east and west coast populations have been rapidly recovering and are now 50% larger than their pre-whaling numbers.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Mountain gorillas in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo

Recent research revealed that an increasing number of mountain gorillas—a species once thought to be extinct by the end of the 20th century—now reside in a large swathe of protected forest in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The 83,840-acre Bwindi-Sarambwe ecosystem that runs from Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, through the Sarambwe Nature Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo, is one of two places on Earth where mountain gorillas still exist with a population of 459 individuals, up from an estimated 400 in 2011.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Snow leopards in Mongolia

Mongolia’s first-ever national snow leopard survey in 2021 showed that the country’s snow leopard population is stable with approximately 953 individuals—an exciting discovery that indicates current conservation efforts are working to protect this charismatic and elusive big cat.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Swift foxes in Montana

In 2020, after a 51-year absence, swift foxes returned to the grasslands of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana, joining other prairie wildlife found within these Native nation-owned lands. Twenty-seven swift foxes were brought to the area from Wyoming in September, marking the beginning of a five-year reintroduction program led by the Nakoda and Aaniiih Nations of Fort Belknap. One litter of kits was documented, and an additional 48 swift foxes were released in 2021, both of which are helping to establish a sustainable population on the Reservation.

### %Eight species making a comeback: Tigers in Nepal

In 2018, Nepal announced that the country’s tiger population estimate had increased to 235, nearly doubling a 2009 baseline of just 121 individual tigers. Nepal is on track to become one of the first countries to double its country’s wild tiger numbers since the ambitious TX2 goal – to double the world’s wild tiger population.
