# %MESOAMERICAN REEF

The Mesoamerican Reef region lies within the Caribbean Sea and touches the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. It contains the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, stretching nearly 700 miles from the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula down through the Honduran Bay Islands. Dazzling arrays of different types of coral form this underwater wilderness, and provide homes and food to hundreds of fish species, marine turtles, and sharks. Along the shores, mangroves provide habitat for fish and shorebirds as well as protect coastal areas from the damage associated with hurricanes and strong storms.

The scenic beauty of the region’s coastal areas makes it a prime tourist destination, which can put pressure on fragile reef environments. Further inland, rich soils attract large-scale agriculture, whose run-off can severely impact reefs. And increasing sea levels and water temperatures from climate change threaten corals and other marine animals such as turtles, as well as the communities that depend on the reef for their livelihoods and food security.

CONTINENT: North America
SPECIES: Hawksbill turtle, Loggerhead turtle, Green turtle, Leatherback turtle, Whale shark

## %SPECIES

Over 60 types of hard corals form a vast network of reef that in turn provides habitat for over 500 fish species, five species of marine turtles and attracts one of the world’s largest congregations of whale sharks.

The main species are:

- Sea Turtle
- Whale Shark
- Hawksbill Turtle
- Loggerhead Turtle
- Leatherback Turtle
- Green Turtle
- Olive Ridley Turtle
- Tuna
- Shark

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

Between one and two million people depend directly on this region’s marine resources for their livelihoods. This is a culturally diverse part of the world, which includes Miskito, Garifuna, Caribbean Creole, Q’eqchi’, Mopan, Yucatec Maya and Mestizo people.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

WWF has studied the vulnerability of coastal communities in Belize and Honduras to climate change impacts because so many people depend on the reef for their livelihoods. Communities were encouraged to suggest their own solutions to the threats they face, which can be incorporated into planning to adapt to climate change. In many places this has included planting more mangroves to improve the ability of coastal areas to withstand storms. We also are part of a weather monitoring network that can help communities prepare for weather-related disasters.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: CONSERVING FRESH WATER

WWF is working with local communities and indigenous groups that live in the catchments upstream of the reef to sustainably manage their natural resources. By keeping critical landscapes in tact, they are ensuring clean, abundant freshwater can continue to flow through important economic areas of the country and safely into the reef’s water.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: HELPING FARMERS

WWF works with agricultural partners to create a weather monitoring system. Using state-of-the-art information and communications technologies, this system supports farmers in their day-to-day management decisions. Information collected will also inform decisions on how to best use water resources and how to prepare for potential disasters in the face of recurring drought and flood.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF
- CLIMATE CHANGE
- TOURISM AND COASTAL DEVELOPMENT
- OVERFISHING

### %THREATS: AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF

Commercial agriculture alters the landscape, disturbs soils and causes enormous amounts of pesticide and sediment runoff, all of which ultimately drain into the reef areas.

### %THREATS: CLIMATE CHANGE

Much of the coastal area surrounding the reef and nearby islands is low-lying and vulnerable to sea level rise from climate change. Eroding shorelines have already been documented, which can affect nesting and reproductive success of marine turtles. Rising water temperatures cause more episodes of coral bleaching, which is devastating to reefs and the wildlife that depend on them. And more frequent and intense storms are having a tremendous impact on communities.

### %THREATS: TOURISM AND COASTAL DEVELOPMENT

Tourism is the largest and fastest growing industry in the world, with major environmental, cultural, social and economic implications. Although tourism can be an opportunity for sustainable development, poorly planned development of hotels and resorts in coastal areas can result in habitat destruction, pollution, and other negative impacts on biodiversity. In the Mesoamerican Reef, tourism-related coastal development is rapidly expanding south from Cancun into Belize and Honduras.

### %THREATS: OVERFISHING

For over 60 years, spiny lobster has been the economic backbone of the region’s coastal fishing communities. However increased demand and years of constant harvesting have taken their toll, and lobster stocks are dwindling rapidly.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE

WWF develops strategies that enable communities to adapt to climate change and prepare for climate-induced weather events, such as drought and stronger storms. We focus on the natural resilience of mangroves and work to ensure these areas remain protected or restored where needed. We monitor coral reef health and marine turtle nesting success as seawater temperatures and levels continue to rise. And we continue to strive to reduce human activities that impact reefs, so that corals can maintain their resilience in the face of climate change.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: BUILDING RESILIENT CORALS

WWF works with local partners and scientists to see whether damaged reef areas can be restored with species of corals that seem more able to withstand the impacts of disease and warmer water temperatures. These corals are being raised in “nursery” reef areas and transplanted onto reefs in marine protected areas (MPAs). Thousands of corals have been successfully planted and are being monitored to test their resilience and how they impact their new reef home. Such nurseries could one day be used to partially restore severely damaged portions of the reef.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: MONITORING CORAL HEALTH

WWF has been working for years with The Nature Conservancy and other marine experts on monitoring coral reef health and developed an ‘early warning system’ to detect changes and signs of coral bleaching. With our partners, we have trained dive guides on how to identify signs of bleaching and report such data to a coral reef monitoring network.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING MARINE TURTLES

WWF has worked with partners to create a turtle monitoring program in Belize to understand how climate change and human activities may be impacting marine turtles. Tour operators and divers have been trained to collect basic data on turtles, such as species and nest locations, and report to a national turtle watch program. Such information will enable scientists to measure impacts of climate change over time. We also work with local resorts and waterfront property owners to improve nesting beach conditions for turtles and help with climate change adaptation.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: RESTORING MANGROVES

Mangroves act as nursery areas for commercial fish species, protect coasts from damaging storms, and provide shade and stabilize beaches where marine turtles nest. WWF works with local partners to produce illustrated guides on mangrove restoration, train local community and school children how to plant mangroves, and work with property developers on how to minimize impacts on mangroves. WWF has also supported an annual competition in Belize for developers, where mangrove-friendly construction projects are rewarded.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: BUILDING SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES

WWF aims to ensure the sustainability of the spiny lobster fishery and conservation of its habitat by promoting better management practices and securing responsible buyers. WWF has built solid relationships with the fishing industry and the Honduran and Nicaraguan governments, resulting in the testing and adoption of a “juvenile-friendly” lobster trap, legislation banning unsustainable fishing practices, and a region-wide ban on lobster fishing during the reproductive season. In Mexico, we have helped one small-scale lobster fishery achieve Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification, and we’d like to see the industrial lobster fisheries in the region achieve MSC certification as well.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: IMPROVING COASTAL DEVELOPMENT

Coastal management decisions are extremely complex and involve many tradeoffs, such as the loss of marine habitat due to revenue-generating development projects. WWF works with the government of Belize to ensure that such decisions minimize impacts on reefs, mangroves and fisheries. In partnership with the Natural Capital Project, we have helped gather critical information about the benefits people receive from the Mesoamerican Reef as well as the impacts human activities have on it. The data is being used to create a new coastal development plan for Belize for sustainable use of its resources.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: SAFEGUARDING WATERSHEDS

WWF works to maintain the health of freshwater sources and reduce erosion of soils into coastal areas in the region. We created an initiative where farmers help protect the water-producing forests in exchange for access to places to grow vegetables for export and for themselves. This protects critical habitats, helps assure the flow of freshwater and strengthens livelihoods in a drought -prone area. This model was successful and is being replicated in Honduras with support from the Coca-Cola Company.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING MARINE AREAS

WWF works to protect important coral reef areas in the Mesoamerican Reef and ensure that they are well managed. We focus on a network of marine sites, including places such as the Bay Islands of Honduras, where an enormous living stand of staghorn coral is found. These corals sit between two cruise ship ports, but despite being in a high human traffic areaand exposure to warmer water temperatures, the stand is thriving. WWF recognized the significance of this stand of coral and the need for further research into its resilience. The stand is now protected by the Honduran government as a result of our efforts and those of regional partners.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: REDUCING IMPACTS FROM TOURISM

WWF supports the development of small scale, community-based tourism, which has less impact on the marine environment and improves livelihoods. Alternative income opportunities include helping local fishermen transition to fishing tour guides. In Mexico, we work at both the state and national level to ensure adoption of sustainable tourism principles. Our state level work focuses on Quintana Roo, home to Cancun’s mega resort developments.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: REDUCING RUNOFF

WWF has been a pioneer in transforming the production of agricultural commodities (shrimp, sugar, banana, palm oil, melon and citrus) to reduce the amount of sediment and chemical pollution that reaches the Mesoamerican Reef’s habitats. We work with producers to minimize their use of chemicals and water and strive to reduce soil erosion and runoff. WWF has already helped sugar producers move away from using pesticides by providing technical assistance on biologically-based methods of pest control. We have also successfully replaced fertilizers with compost in palm oil plantations in Honduras. We also work in the industrial sector to reduce their water consumption and the wastewater they generate. For example, through our global partnership, we have successfully engaged all of the Coca-Cola Company’s bottlers in the region in our water saving efforts.

## %In Belize, a flourishing marine reserve showcases the benefits of protecting coral reefs

Bobbing gently in the waters of Belize’s Hol Chan Marine Reserve is a jaunty and unique floating ranger station. The pontoon boat, complete with a porch, murals of ocean life, and a weather station, welcomes visitors to a well-preserved section of one of the Caribbean’s shiniest jewels: the Belize Barrier Reef.

Snorkelers and divers travel from all over the world to dip their heads beneath these crystal waters and it’s no secret why. Here, abundant schools of fish flick their fins simultaneously while nurse sharks roam along the sand. Structural coral rises stalwart from the sea floor—the first line of defense against a storm—and fan-like species sway in the mild current. Seagrass beds stretch into the distance.

It's easy for Hol Chan Marine Reserve ranger Manuel Munoz to characterize this protected area.

“I would use one word,” he says. “Unique."

Hol Chan—Mayan for “little channel”—is a prime example of how a well-operated marine reserve benefits both the environment and economy alike—and makes a convincing case for replicating the model elsewhere. Established in 1987 mainly in response to community concern over uncontrolled fishing and diving, Hol Chan is Belize’s oldest protected area and covers about three square miles of reef, seagrass beds, and mangroves. All three elements are critical to protecting wildlife, coastal communities, and the climate. Coral reefs and mangroves protect the shoreline during storms and serve as critical habitat for wildlife, and mangroves also help prevent erosion. And while seagrass provides a place for species such as manatees and sea turtles to feed and live, it can also capture carbon up to 35 times faster than tropical rain forests—an essential characteristic for curbing the climate crisis.

Rangers like Munoz welcome about 500 people a day to the flourishing reef. They work both to ensure the safety of visitors to the reserve and enforce the security of the barrier reef and its vast marine life.

“You need to be able to have constant eyes on the water, on the reef, to be able to put in place actions to make sure that the reef is safeguarded,” said Nadia Bood, senior program officer for marine science and climate change at WWF-Belize.

And successful protection of such a precious natural resource is only achieved with the help of all interested parties, from government to community to business. Hol Chan Marine Reserve staff members conduct community outreach to connect people to the reef, working with everyone from primary school students to owners and employees of local businesses. Conservation organizations such as WWF, the MarAlliance, and others, that help conduct research and provide critical information that supports effective management of our oceans also play an important role in protecting wildlife and their habitats.

The visibility of the reef from the shoreline—one can watch the waves break against it while standing on the beach—and its proximity to Ambergris Caye, a long, skinny island off the eastern shore of Belize, contribute to a prevailing desire to protect it. And generations of families have fed their loved ones by fishing the reef.

“You are seeing tourists excited to go and visit the reef, to snorkel and dive the reef. You are seeing fishers come in with daily catch from the reef,” Bood said. “The reef is close to the community’s heart.”

Back at the ranger station, Munoz watches as boats full of eager tourists putter into the reef for a morning of snorkeling and diving. Sounds of exhilaration ripple through the air. He is proud of his position and what it means for visitors, locals, and Belize.

“It shows them that I'm doing something positive,” he says. “Not just for myself, not for just the community, but also for the future.”

## %WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT CORAL REEFS IN 2019

Coral reefs are some of the most beautifully complex systems on the planet. Unfortunately, they’re breaking because of pollution, overexploitation, and the climate crisis.

Thanks to science and fieldwork over 2019 we learned even more about the state of coral reefs and the people who depend on them. While most of what we’ve learned is grim, there are places of hopeful determination fueled by a vision that all is not lost.

In this new decade, there’s much we can do to protect coral reefs and the wildlife and people that depend on them for survival. Here’s what we’ve learned about these magnificent ecosystems and what actions we need to take in 2020.

### %WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT CORAL REEFS IN 2019: The ocean is getting too warm for many corals

The climate warning light is no longer flashing on and off—it is permanently glowing red. In September the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change cautioned that even if governments are able to reduce emissions and limit the average global temperature rise to 1.5°C—an extremely optimistic scenario given current commitments and ambition—anywhere from 70% to 90% of tropical coral reefs could be lost by 2100. And if the world fails to keep warming from reaching 2°C, almost no reefs will survive.

This isn’t entirely unexpected, but it is an important, if hard-to-stomach, reminder. A few years ago I co-authored a paper that projected nearly all coral reefs would experience annual bleaching by 2050. Given what we know today, that may have been a conservative estimate.

### %WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT CORAL REEFS IN 2019: Localized threats further weaken reefs

We’re also losing coral reefs to local problems, like pollution in run-off and harmful fishing practices. These threats make reefs less resilient to withstanding warming and acidifying waters brought on by the climate crisis.

This year we learned that fish fences—a technique used commonly in tropical coastal communities to indiscriminately trap fish with changing tides—are doing more damage to coral reef ecosystems than previously thought. The number of reef fish declined by about half in some places due to fish fences that catch vulnerable species and the smallest fish.

### %WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT CORAL REEFS IN 2019: Communities are engaged and empowered

Losing access to fish threatens the survival of thousands of coastal communities. More than 850 million people live close to coral reefs and benefit from the food, jobs, and protection they provide. Those services are estimated to be worth $375 billion every year, though in reality when all benefits to people are considered, that value is likely to be significantly higher.

Providing support for these communities to help them identify the best fishing methods, for example, is one of the most effective ways to conserve coastal marine environments and set up them up to have the best shot at surviving climate change.

### %WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT CORAL REEFS IN 2019: Rescue the reefs that can bring the ocean back to life

Losing coral reefs isn’t just a problem in coastal communities—it is a global issue. The entire world must take action to give reefs a chance because the challenge is far too great for any single group to go it alone.

In the summer of 2019 I joined a group of 80 scientists to publish a paper that identified the best strategies for saving reefs in an age of a rapidly warming climate. Protecting those coral reefs that have been exposed to less intense climate disturbances while recovering those reefs that are likely to function again is a smart way to deploy limited resources. At the same time, in those regions where coral reefs cannot be protected or recovered, we must help local communities shift away from jobs and economies that depend on reefs.

WWF has taken an integrated approach to ensure intact, connected coastal ecosystems are protected and restored, and coastal communities are benefitting from equitable and effective management as well as the sustainable harvest of marine resources. We’ve focused our efforts locally in places like Indonesia, the Northern Mozambique Channel, and the Mesoamerican Reef, and at the same time helped form a global coalition of organizations working on an initiative called Coral Reef Rescue, designed to provide the resources and political will to support communities in saving key regenerative reefs.

Last year I traveled to Indonesia, coastal east Africa and Madagascar, and in every community, I encountered a drive to do whatever it takes to protect coral reefs, as well as mangroves, and the benefits they provide. Now we need to match that local energy with a global movement.

We can save coral reefs but we only have about 10 years left to do it. This year we need to focus our efforts and work harder than ever before.

## %Swimming with whale sharks near the Mesoamerican Reef

ISLA HOLBOX :: MEXICO

As we walk from our seaside cabana toward the water, the salty ocean breeze dusts our faces. We wade out knee-deep in the turquoise water to board our panga. The anticipation in the air is palpable as we motor comfortably across the glass-smooth ocean. When the captain slows the engine, the excitement rises and we perch on the edges of the boat on high alert, searching the horizon for the telltale fins of the gentle giants we’ve come to visit.

We are just off the tip of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula near Isla Holbox, a delightful, little-visited island with streets of white sand and virtually no cars. Our mission? To swim with the world’s biggest fish, whale sharks, which gather off Mexico’s coast during the summer months to feed on plankton.

Having spotted a pair of these harmless behemoths, our captain positions our boat directly in their path. Outfitted with fins, mask, and snorkel, two of us and our guide slide off the edge of the boat. As the bubbles from our plunge dissipate into the water, we stare forward, waiting eagerly for the huge fish to appear.

Suddenly, our guide points animatedly. The whale shark emerges out of nowhere, square head coming nearly right at us, mouth open. Paralyzed by awe, we are motionless as the shark swims gracefully off to our side, seemingly docile and unafraid.

Our eyes dance, following the intricate checkerboard pattern of pale yellow dots and stripes on its skin, which shimmers in the sunlight. It’s a fantastical image, an underwater leopard. I feel like it takes a full minute for the shark to swim by, but as the tail fin sways past our masks, I realize that I had better start swimming myself, if I want this magical moment to last any longer.

## %Belize ends oil activity in its ocean waters

Belize, home of the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere, permanently suspended oil activity in its ocean waters. The legislation marks the first time that a developing country has taken such a major step to protect its oceans—and all the life within—from oil exploration and extraction.

The new suspension of oil activity marks an enormous win for the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System World Heritage site, the wildlife that live there, and the hundreds of thousands of Belizeans who rely on the reef for survival. 

“Today is a great day for Belize,” said Nadia Bood, Mesoamerican reef scientist at WWF. “Not only has its government listened to calls to protect the Belize Barrier Reef, which only last year was under threat from seismic oil exploration, it has stepped up to become a world leader in ocean protection by ending all oil activity in its waters.”

Ecosystems in the reef have already been damaged by coastal construction, and potential oil drilling posed a major threat. Harmful industrial activities would impact Belize’s economy, natural resources, and the 1,400 species found in the reef system.

More than 450,000 people from around the world joined WWF’s campaign to end oil exploration and other harmful activities in the reef.

The Belize barrier reef teems with life that will benefit from the new protections. The endangered hawksbill turtle, manatees, and six threatened species of shark live in these waters. Vibrant corals abound, and aquatic animals shelter their young in mangrove forests along the coast. 

And people will benefit from a healthy reef, too. Belize’s economy is built on tourism, so the health of the reef directly impacts the country’s future. Tourism alone is estimated to bring in between $182 million to $237 million per year, with reef-related tourism and fisheries supporting about 190,000 people.

“By acting to remove a major threat to the reef, Belize is safeguarding its future prosperity,” Bood said. "We hope today’s announcement will encourage other countries to follow suit and take urgent actions needed to protect our planet’s oceans.”

## %Making the financial case for protecting Belize’s barrier reef

The Belize barrier reef is one of the most magnificent, diverse ecosystems on Earth. But it’s nearly 1,400 species—including sharks, vibrant corals and mangroves—are threatened by coastal destruction and a lack of strong regulations. A first-of-its-kind report, released in collaboration with our partners in the region, warns that Belize stands to lose millions in revenue generated by one sector alone if protections aren’t put in place and enforced.

Natural Heritage, Natural Wealth quantified the tourism benefits the Belize Barrier Reef World Heritage site provides to the country. The report assessed four of the region’s seven marine protected areas—Blue Hole & Half Moon Caye Natural Monuments, Glover’s Reef Atoll Marine Reserve, and Laughing Bird Caye National Park. The analysis found that these protected areas provide up to $19 million per year in economic benefits from tourism recreation, which is a fragment of the total socio-economic value to Belize.

“The World Heritage site is not just irreplaceable, it is vital to the country’s future prosperity,” said Nadia Bood, Mesoamerican Reef scientist at WWF in Belize. “Belize’s government should be doing everything it can to protect this incredible natural and economic resource.”

This summer, WWF published an evaluation of the progress made by the Belizean government in implementing promised protections for the reef, which since 2009 has languished on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The analysis found the reef had not received necessary protections. Then, in August, Belize announced it would implement a moratorium on oil drilling in and around its barrier reef system. Still, more needs to be done.

While tourism and recreation are vital to the people of Belize, the barrier reef also provides access to productive fisheries along with a range of important ecosystem services, like protection against increasingly extreme coastal storms.

Greater investment is urgently needed to promote sustainable development and protect the entire ecosystem. As this latest report demonstrates, the economic benefits far outweigh any cost associated with managing the Belize Barrier Reef.

## %A new plan to save Belize's livelihood-giving reef and coasts

The coastal nation of Belize is at a crossroads. The Belize Barrier Reef System supports the livelihoods of more than half the nation’s population and provides numerous benefits including cultural heritage, protection from storms, and habitat for endangered species. 

But this same ecosystem is under threat. In 2009, the reef system was added to UNESCO’s List of World Heritage in Danger. It remains on the list today because of mangrove deforestation, unsustainable coastal development and offshore oil exploration.

The good news is a coastal zone management plan can safeguard Belize’s natural assets and produce a win-win opportunity for the people and environment. New research by WWF scientists and collaborators describes the government-led planning process which identified risks posed by human activities and measured how different development decisions impact the Belizean people and species.

For six years, the team organized meetings with Belizean community leaders, tour guide associations, fishing cooperatives, businesses, academia and civil society. These stakeholders discussed ongoing problems related to the barrier reef, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. Issues included the depletion of fishing stocks due to mangrove destruction and overfishing, the negative impact of agricultural runoff on tourism, unplanned coastal development and beach erosion.  Local citizens also noted problems with river flooding, which contaminates seawater during the rainy season.

The planning and research teams combined this input with scientific research, development guidelines, and government reports to create a detailed picture of Belize’s coastal resources, the most important benefits derived from them, and the main activities in each region. 

Their results became the basis for Belize’s first Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan (ICZMP). Signed into law in August 2016, the ICZMP establishes guidelines for the sustainable use of coastal-marine resources in and around Belize’s livelihood-giving reef and coasts.

Belize regularly receives proposals from foreign interests to develop its cayes and atolls - the small islands between the barrier reef and mainland. Government agencies and NGOs can quickly evaluate whether a given pitch fits into this shared sustainable vision and aligns with local development guidelines. The plan also provides a comprehensive run-down of development and conservation opportunities, including specific impacts (loss of revenue, jobs, the amount and location of mangrove habitat at highest risk to degradation) and benefits to Belize’s coastal communities.

The Belize ICZMP lays the groundwork for a zoning scheme that protects the coastal zone and establishes much needed baselines for the eventual de-listing of the reef system from UNESCO’s “in danger” list. It’s also a model for other coastal nations around the world where overfishing and habitat degradation are increasingly serious problems.

## %Belize fails to implement promised protections for the Belize Barrier Reef World Heritage site

The government of Belize has not put into place promised protections for the Belize Barrier Reef World Heritage site, leaving the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere under threat from offshore oil drilling and damaging coastal construction, according to a new WWF assessment.

Key concerns include a lack of progress over the last year on legislation to ban offshore oil exploration and production within the reef site and buffer areas, despite a government announcement of the ban in 2015. And there’s also no legislation to prohibit the sale of public land in the World Heritage site. In 2015, the Belizean government committed to taking such measures by last December.

“Seven months on, Belize has not delivered on its promise to protect the Belize Barrier Reef,” said Nadia Bood, a Mesoamerican Reef scientist at WWF. “Instead, this remarkable ecosystem — vital to both wildlife and the country’s economy — remains under threat. We urge Belize’s government to act immediately to safeguard the reef for future generations.”

About 1,400 species live in the reef system, and more than half of the country’s population relies on income generated from reef-related tourism and fisheries. A full 15% of the country’s gross domestic product comes from the reef—including about $15 million from the commercial fishing industry and about $200 million from tourism activities. This natural barrier also saves Belize up to $350 million per year in avoided damage from storms and other natural disasters.

In 2009, UNESCO placed Belize’s reef system on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of concerns over the development of mangrove islands and the absence of a solid regulatory framework to ensure the reef’s protection. Worldwide, 114 natural and mixed World Heritage sites out of 229 either have oil, gas, or mining concessions overlapping them, or are under threat from at least one other harmful industrial activity.

“Right now, Belize’s only World Heritage site is at a crossroads,” said Elena Khishchenko, global campaigns manager at WWF. “Unless urgent action is taken, it risks suffering irreversible damage.”

## %Working together to save World Heritage Sites

UNESCO World Heritage sites provide food, water, shelter and medicine to millions of people, contain ecosystems that are essential to many species and to the environment, and contribute to economic and social development. Yet nearly half of these sites are threatened by harmful industrial activities.

On World Heritage Day, we’re highlighting some of the incredible sites that WWF is working to save:

- Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System
- Selous Game Reserve
- Doñana National Park
- Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve

### %Working together to save World Heritage Sites: Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System

The Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System is home to over 1,400 species, from the loggerhead turtle to the West Indian manatee. Vibrant corals abound, and aquatic animals shelter their young in the mangrove forests. Both people and wildlife depend on this magnificent reef for protection and income. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996, and is made up of seven protected areas, including the Blue Hole Natural Monument and Laughing Bird Caye National Park.

Mangrove forests: Mangrove forests along Belize’s shoreline have an amazing capacity to store carbon, and they might be one of nature’s best defenses against a changing climate. They constitute some of the most dynamic and biologically complex ecosystems on Earth. They keep systems healthy and protect resources—from fisheries to firewood—that support human populations. Unfortunately, more than 35% of the world’s mangroves are already gone. Protecting Belize’s Barrier Reef means protecting these valuable mangrove forests. 

Livelihoods: Nearly 200,000 Belizeans are estimated to rely on the Belize barrier reef for their livelihoods. Fifteen percent of the country’s gross domestic product comes from the reef—including about $15 million from the commercial fishing industry and about $200 million from tourism activities, like scuba diving in the Blue Hole Monument. Coral reefs and mangroves also provide protection against storm surges, hurricanes, and erosion, saving Belize up to $350 million per year in avoided damage.

Under threat: In 2009, UNESCO placed the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Ecosystems in the system have already been damaged by coastal construction, and potential oil drilling poses a major threat. These harmful industrial activities would impact Belize’s economy, natural resources, and the species that live in the reef system. With your help, we can protect this World Heritage site.

### %Working together to save World Heritage Sites: Selous Game Reserve

Selous Game Reserve, one of Africa’s oldest reserves and Tanzania’s largest protected area, is also the only site in southern Tanzania to have been awarded World Heritage status. Selous is filled with a variety of wildlife including African elephants, black rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, giraffes, African wild dogs, and cheetahs. Tourists come from all over the world to see the animals.

Elephant poaching: Rampant ivory poaching has reduced the elephant population in Selous by 90% in less than 40 years. Almost 110,000 elephants used to roam the reserve, but only 15,000 elephants remain. Industrial projects have made it easier for poachers to access the park and to traffic illegal ivory. There are strong moral and ethical arguments for conserving elephants, but investing in elephant conservation is a good economic decision, too. African countries lose approximately $25 million annually in tourism revenue due to current levels of elephant poaching.

Supporting rangers: Rangers are vital in the effort to protect World Heritage Sites like Selous Game Reserve. Poachers threaten the safety of rangers on the front lines of conservation. They work tirelessly to watch over some of the most endangered wildlife on the planet, sometimes risking their lives. Rangers across Africa say they need better training and equipment to prevent the rampant poaching, as well as the respect and support of their governments, and enforcement of national laws against poaching.

Protecting the reserve: Selous Game Reserve holds enormous environmental, social, and economic value. Along with industrial level poaching, Selous faces threats from mining, oil and gas exploration, and dam construction. In addition to putting an end to wildlife crime, WWF is calling for an assessment of the impacts of these proposed industrial activities, and investment in environmentally friendly tourism that will benefit nearby communities. Let’s work together to protect Selous.

### %Working together to save World Heritage Sites: Doñana National Park

World Heritage Site Doñana National Park, located in Spain, where the Guadalquivir River reaches the Atlantic Ocean, is considered one of the most valuable wetlands in Europe. Doñana is a haven for millions of migratory birds on their journey between Europe and Africa. It is also home to many threatened species like the imperial eagle and Iberian lynx, and provides important local and global ecosystem services.

Ecosystem services: The diversity of Doñana’s ecosystems provides habitats for up to 6 million migratory birds each year. It is home to over 4,000 species, and 75% of European bird types can be found here. As a wetland, Doñana also provides air and water purification, water regulation, and soil fertilization services. It acts as a net carbon sink, removing carbon from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Wetlands also provide flood control, clean water, shoreline and storm protection, materials, medicines, and vital habitat.

Under threat: Doñana also plays a vital role in Spain’s economy, providing for the well-being of 170,000 people living nearby. As destruction of Doñana continues, fishers are seeing a reduction in their catches, and fewer tourists are visiting. National laws should ensure that Doñana is protected. However, illegal wells and farms, proposed mining and gas projects, and dredging of the Guadalquivir River are all endangering Doñana.

Protecting wetlands: It is speculated that upward of half of the world’s wetlands have disappeared since 1900, despite their value to the human population. WWF is working to conserve and protect these valuable habitats. UNESCO has stated that oil, gas and mining exploitation are incompatible with World Heritage status, but Spain continues to pursue perilous gas and mining projects near the site. Doñana would be the first European Union site to be placed on UNESCO’s List of World Heritage in Danger.

### %Working together to save World Heritage Sites: Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve

The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Mexico, 139,000-acre World Heritage Site, protects the monarch butterflies’ wintering habitats. Flying 1,200 to 2,800 miles over the course of two months, monarchs leave their summer breeding areas in Southeast Canada and Northeast United States to hibernate in the forests of central Mexico. These same butterflies will return to the US at the beginning of Spring, and the next 2 to 4 generations will continue the migration North.

A long journey: Monarchs exhibit the most highly evolved migration pattern of any known species of butterfly or moth. Their scientific name, Danaus plexippus, means “sleepy transformation” in Greek, which evokes the species' ability to hibernate and metamorphize. Unfortunately, the migratory monarch butterflies have been on the decline for decades. Milkweed, where monarchs lay their eggs and the source of food for baby caterpillars, is disappearing due to herbicide use and land conversion. Illegal logging in Mexico still threatens their winter habitat, and climate change in Canada, the US, and Mexico is an additional threat to these delicate but amazing butterflies.

Preserving habitat: More than 150,000 tourists visit the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve every year. This phenomenon is a magnificent site to behold: the trees hum with the sound of their wings, and the branches are covered in the delicate butterflies. The same forests that these butterflies migrate to are also inhabited by communities that rely on the forest and its resources for survival. WWF works to preserve the habitat by promoting good forest management, sustainable tourism, and sustainable projects that provide additional  economic benefits to local communities.

Saving monarchs: The latest survey conducted at the reserve reminds us how much these butterflies need our protection. The area occupied by the butterfly colonies has decreased 27% compared to last year’s survey. This reduction was probably caused by storms and cold weather last year. While monarchs benefit from the reserve, they also need protected food and habitat during their migration through Canada and the US.

## %A new way to predict and prevent the end of coral reefs

For the first time, researchers have created models to predict when, where, and to what extent coral bleaching will occur in reefs around the world at a finer scale than ever before. Because many countries depend on their reefs for food, tourism, and costal protection, knowing when and where bleaching will occur could help government officials, natural resource managers, and conservationists make informed decisions on how and where to prioritize conservation work.

Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to climate change impacts because they are easily stressed by changes in water temperature. Bleaching occurs when above-average sea temperatures or other stressors disrupt coral’s mutualistic relationship with the algae, called zooxanthellae, that lives within its tissue. When stressed, the algae leaves the coral, causing it to turn white and leaving it much more vulnerable to disease and death.

The study, entitled “Local-scale projections of coral reef futures and implications of the Paris Agreement,” published in Nature Scientific Reports, predicts that all coral reefs will experience annual bleaching by the end of this century, but tells us which reefs are likely to bleach sooner. Scientists from multiple organizations and universities analyzed data on where warming sea surface temperatures will have the greatest effects on reefs in the near future. 

The models created in the study account for two emissions scenarios: assuming pledges 196 nations made in a landmark global plan to curb climate change take place, and assuming nations do not follow through on the agreements. Even if everyone follows through on their commitments to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, coral reefs are still on the decline and expected to experience severe loss in the coming decades. But this loss will be comparatively slower and allow more time for people to develop and implement potential solutions to the problem.

“We are going to need to be much more innovative and proactive if we want to see coral reefs thrive into the next century,” said WWF lead marine scientist and study co-author Dr. Gabby Ahmadia. “Conventional conservation is not going to cut it against the impacts of climate change. We need to embrace the new climate reality to guide efforts to save our oceans”.

Corals can sometimes recover, depending on the severity of the bleaching, but they don’t always. Just this last year, more than 90% of coral on the Northern Great Barrier Reef in Australia was affected by bleaching, and more than 20% of it died as a result.

Support for the study, entitled “Local-scale projections of coral reef futures and implications of the Paris Agreement,” was provided by UN Environment, WWF, NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation Programme, the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory and the National Marine Fisheries Service via the PIFSC, USGS via the Pacific Islands Climate Science Center, Total Foundation, and US National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.

## %Saving Belize’s magnificent and endangered barrier reef

The coral reefs and coastal mangroves of Belize teem with life: sea turtles glide through clear waters; vibrant corals stud the ocean floor; and a vast array of aquatic animals protect their young in the tangled roots of mangroves. They’re necessary for both the wildlife that live there and the people who rely on it for income and protection.

But ecosystems in the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System have already been damaged by coastal construction, and potential oil drilling poses a major threat. These harmful industrial activities would impact Belize’s economy, natural resources, and the 1,400 species that live in the reef system.

“Coral reefs are the cornerstones of some of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet, and they provide loads of benefits to people,” said Brad Ack, WWF’s senior vice president for oceans. “Conserving reefs protects our common futures and the amazing marine species that depend on them.”

In 2009, UNESCO placed Belize’s reef system on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Worldwide, 114 natural and mixed World Heritage sites out of 229 either have oil, gas, or mining concessions overlapping them, or are under threat from at least one other harmful industrial activity.

Now more than ever, we need to protect World Heritage sites like the reef in Belize and safeguard these natural treasures and the benefits they provide.

“Conserving the environment does not hurt economic opportunities,” said Roberto Troya, WWF’s director for Latin America and the Caribbean. “It allows us to build sustainably on these irreplaceable assets. Threats to World Heritage sites in places as diverse as Belize, Spain, and Tanzania demonstrate how widespread the risks run and should unite us in our effort to protect these essential areas.”

Nearly 200,000 Belizeans are estimated to rely on the reef for survival. And 15 percent of the country’s gross domestic product comes from the reef—including about $15 million from the commercial fishing industry and about $200 million from tourism activities. This natural barrier also saves Belize up to $350 million per year in avoided damage from storms and other disasters.

This type of reliance is not unique to Belize; 11 million people around the world depend on World Heritage sites. These sites belong to all of us, and together we must remove the dangers they face.
