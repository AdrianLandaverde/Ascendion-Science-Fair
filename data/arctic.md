# %ARCTIC

The Arctic is a region like no other in the world and it’s warming twice as fast, bringing with it rapid change impacting life on land and at sea. 

About 4 million people live in the Arctic, spread out over eight countries, including the United States. Diverse landscapes—from the sea ice to coastal wetlands, upland tundra, mountains, wide rivers, and the sea itself—support abundant wildlife and many cultures. Of all the wildlife in the Arctic, the polar bear is the most fitting icon for this region. It's amazing adaptation to life in the harsh Arctic environment makes it an impressive species.

Within America’s Arctic, the remarkably productive waters of the Bering Sea attract marine mammals, such as gray whales, which travel great distances to forage and raise their young. Almost half of the fish caught in the United States comes from here making fisheries vital to local livelihoods. Across the Bering Sea in Russia, the Kamchatka Peninsula’s river systems produce up to one-quarter of all wild Pacific salmon. The salmon provide nourishment to other wildlife, including the Kamchatka brown bear.

The Arctic, including the Bering, Beaufort and Chukchi seas, now faces an uncertain future due to climate change, mining, shipping, oil and gas development, and overfishing.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: LIVING IN THE ARCTIC

In the Arctic, nature operates at extremes. The climate is intense, the landscape is often treacherous, and the weather can be brutal. No matter the season, everyday life for the 4 million people living in the region is inextricably linked to the environment.

As a rapidly warming climate brings on new conservation challenges, these problems impact both people and nature. Shrinking sea ice forces polar bears to spend more time on land, and people and bears can come into conflict. New ambitions to drill for oil and gas bring never-before-seen risk to regions that are home to some of the most pristine habitats (or landscapes) and unique wildlife on the planet.

Arctic Indigenous peoples are acutely aware of these growing tensions. They’ve lived off the land and hunted animals for food, clothing, and other essential uses for generations. Such a way of life is threatened almost daily by climate extremes.

The Arctic Council reports that roughly 400,000 Indigenous people live throughout the Arctic. They speak over 40 languages, some of which have few remaining speakers. Still, estimating the number of Indigenous people in the Arctic is difficult. Not everybody collects the numbers, and different countries define “Indigenous” differently.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: IVORY IN THE ARCTIC

WWF recognizes that "ivory" refers to material from several species in addition to elephants, including mastodon and mammoth tusks, hippopotamus teeth, narwhal tusks, and walrus tusks. These types of ivory are exempt from the US federal elephant ivory ban, and it is legal for Alaskan Indigenous people to hunt walrus and sell walrus ivory carvings. Many remote coastal communities in Alaska depend on walrus for food. Walrus are culturally and economically important for these communities, and the tusks are often carved into jewelry and artwork.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- CLIMATE CHANGE
- DRILLING FOR OIL AND GAS
- MINING
- SHIPPING TRAFFIC
- UNSUSTAINABLE FISHING

### %THREATS: CLIMATE CHANGE

The release of greenhouse gasses from the burning of fossil fuels and other sources is causing temperatures in the Arctic to warm at twice the rate of the rest of the world, resulting in lower levels of sea ice, melting permafrost and rising sea levels all over the world. The decrease in volume and extent of Arctic sea ice has serious implications for marine mammals that depend on the ice for their survival, such as ringed seals and polar bears. The burning of fossil fuels is also making Arctic waters more acidic, harming zooplankton species like pterapods—the very base of the Arctic’s rich food chain—as well as corals and shellfish.

### %THREATS: DRILLING FOR OIL AND GAS

Much of the world’s untapped oil reserves lie offshore, beneath the Arctic's biologically productive waters. Exploring and developing these resources in the remote and unforgiving Arctic comes with extreme risks. Oil spills can kill birds, fish and marine mammals, as well as the smaller organisms that provide food for these larger species. There is no proven technology that allows for the complete containment of oil spilled in the marine environment. These challenges are even greater in the extreme conditions of the Arctic, where storms are frequent, ice is still present for much of the year, daylight nonexistent during the winter, and response infrastructure is more than 1,000 miles away. Oil development can also generate life-threatening levels of ocean noise pollution for marine mammals.

### %THREATS: MINING

Some Arctic regions contain valuable minerals, including copper, gold, and coal. One such area lies at the headwaters of two of the most productive rivers that feed into Bristol Bay. If permitted and constructed, the proposed Pebble Mine would be the largest open-pit copper and gold mine in North America. Based on current projections, the mine would permanently destroy miles of important salmon habitat and generate up to 10 billion tons of toxic waste. Release of this toxic waste would devastate freshwater ecosystems and impact the region’s unmatched salmon runs as well as the communities, commercial fishing industry, and wildlife which depend on them.

### %THREATS: SHIPPING TRAFFIC

Climate change has brought on longer open water seasons, which coupled with the growing pressures of globalization, means more of the Arctic’s waterways are opening for travel and commercial transportation. Ship traffic in the Bering Strait alone, the narrow waterway between Alaska and Russia, is likely to increase in the coming years. More ships means a greater risk of wrecks, spills, noise, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species. Still, much of the Arctic Ocean has not been adequately surveyed and there a lot of work to be done to establish new routing and regulations.

### THREATS: UNSUSTAINABLE FISHING

The Arctic has four of the world’s 10 major fisheries, including salmon and pollock, along with a substantial amount of community-based and subsistence fishing. Access to fishing is a significant opportunity for Arctic peoples but climate change and the world’s growing appetite for fish creates new stresses on the ocean. WWF supports proactive fisheries managers of Alaska’s waters who have prohibited the expansion of trawl fisheries into the northern Bering Sea until fish stocks can be understood and managed sustainably.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: CLIMATE SMART, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

As the climate changes, Arctic ecosystems are under growing pressure from industry seeking to expand. Activities including oil development, mining, shipping and cruise tourism are often presented as potential pathways to economic development opportunities. While WWF works to ensure that this development is sustainable, we also work to make certain that economic growth is sustainable and conserves the Arctic’s unique places and species.

WWF continues to engage in efforts to prevent new oil and gas drilling in America’s Arctic as well as ensure that local communities have access to renewable energy options. Our work is also focused on fishing that is sustainable, certified and returning the maximum benefit to local communities.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: IMPROVING GOVERNANCE

WWF actively engages with numerous local, national and regional institutions responsible for governing various activities in the Arctic. This work includes the Arctic Council, the high-level intergovernmental forum on Arctic conservation and sustainable development. WWF has been an Observer since 1998.

In 2017, WWF completed the first-ever assessment of the implementation of Arctic Council conservation-related direction, the WWF Arctic Council Conservation Scorecard. This project will continue to assess the implementation of Council direction together with national governments, encouraging them to provide reporting and advocating for a more effective and transparent Council.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROTECTING ECOLOGICALLY CRITICAL AREAS

Our vision of a well-managed, biodiverse Arctic is one where key habitats, ecosystems and populations of priority species are shielded from the direct pressures of human activity. This means establishing a network of specially managed marine areas across the Arctic to protect marine life and help it adapt to changing conditions. WWF is also working for the implementation of effective management measures to complement these areas. In addition, WWF has a work stream dedicated to reducing the major threat to biodiversity in the Arctic—climate change.

## %WWF’s Kyle Newman on conservation, community, and indispensable Indigenous knowledge

The Amazon helps stabilize the global climate and is home to more than 40 million people and around 10% of the world’s known species. To protect the world’s largest tropical rain forest, Brazil launched the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program with WWF and partners in 2002, setting an aspirational goal: permanently secure more than 150 million acres of the Brazilian Amazon.

Two decades later, ARPA has exceeded that vision, with its protected areas totaling 154 million acres, an area nearly 1.5 times the size of California. Through sustainable financing and strong community partnerships, ARPA has safeguarded biodiversity, protected natural resources, and reduced deforestation by approximately 650,000 acres between 2008 and 2020—preventing significant carbon emissions while supporting local livelihoods.

Large-scale, well-managed protected areas are one of the most effective strategies for keeping forests intact. ARPA will continue to develop and implement novel approaches to conserving this invaluable rain forest—for the next 20 years and beyond.

## %SECRETS IN THE SNOW

Polar bears—iconic symbols of the Arctic and beyond—are as elusive as they are majestic. But understanding how they’re faring is of utmost importance to scientists. These apex predators serve as a bellwether for the health of many other species and the ecosystems of the region’s oceans. In other words, if polar bears are thriving, we can infer that other wildlife in their habitat is healthy, too.

Conventional methods for collecting DNA samples from these bears to learn more about their status are both inefficient and costly. Fortunately, we’ve developed an exciting new way to gather this critical information that only requires the footprints that polar bears leave behind in the snow.

In a landmark study published in Frontiers in Conservation Science, WWF, and collaborators have unveiled an innovative method for extracting DNA from the snow tracks of three elusive carnivores, including polar bears. The new technique involves retrieving trace amounts of environmental DNA—known as eDNA—shed from the footpads of these animals in the snow, enabling the identification of individual animals.

WWF’s work in the Arctic is focused on protecting and restoring the ecosystems that wildlife and the people of the region depend on.

### %SECRETS IN THE SNOW: The climate crisis and conservation challenges

Polar bears face unprecedented challenges due to the climate crisis. Rapidly disappearing sea ice threatens their homes and food sources. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) predicts a significant decline—over 30%—in the global polar bear population by 2050. The study highlights the urgent need for effective conservation strategies.

### %SECRETS IN THE SNOW: eDNA: a game-changer

All animals shed DNA, including by sweating and breathing, as they move about their environment. Conventional methods for tissue collection typically involve locating bears by helicopter and either capturing them to retrieve samples or using a biopsy tool to safely collect DNA from a distance—both time consuming, expensive, and difficult practices. The breakthrough in this study involves non-invasive collection of skin cells from pawprints embedded in the snow, providing an additional tool for monitoring and understanding polar bear populations. Using eDNA sampling together with other monitoring methods provides more data that gives us a much clearer picture of the health of a given polar bear population.

### %SECRETS IN THE SNOW: The significance of snow tracks

Polar bear habitats are massive, and finding polar bear tracks is significantly easier than finding an actual bear. By collecting cells from snow tracks, scientists can retrieve eDNA without interacting with animals. The method has been refined through fieldwork in Alaska, Norway, and Sweden, leading to a protocol for collecting and preparing snow from tracks for laboratory analysis.

### %SECRETS IN THE SNOW: The hard-to-study polar bears

Studying polar bears poses numerous challenges, given their solitary nature, vast ranges, and limited accessibility for scientists. The data deficiency in many subpopulations complicates conservation efforts. The newly developed eDNA method offers a cost-effective and efficient way to gather crucial baseline data for understanding trends and implementing conservation interventions.

### %SECRETS IN THE SNOW: Participatory conservation

This technique is not limited to scientists; there is potential for other groups, including community members, volunteers, and other wildlife trackers to actively participate in monitoring and managing these bears. This approach supports WWF’s goals in the Arctic of bringing people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skills together in the preservation of these majestic creatures and their habitats.

### %SECRETS IN THE SNOW: The hope for impact

The eDNA method fills a critical gap in data gathering, offering a new way to collect information crucial for assessing genetic diversity and population resilience in the face of environmental changes and challenges like a rapidly warming planet. The technique also holds promise for studying other elusive species that leave pawprints in the snow, and scientists have already successfully used it with the Eurasian lynx and snow leopards—the other species talked about in this study. By expanding the toolbox for data collection, researchers aim to enhance conservation efforts and develop less invasive methods in collaboration with local communities.

### %SECRETS IN THE SNOW: An important advancement for conservation

Snow pawprint eDNA collection represents a significant leap forward in the conservation of elusive Arctic carnivores. As climate change continues to threaten these species, the people of the Arctic, and our oceans, innovative approaches like this provide hope for a future in which better data leads to more effective conservation strategies for polar bears and other wildlife. Through collaboration among scientists, conservationists, and local communities, we can unlock the secrets hidden in the snow and work toward a healthier Arctic for people and the planet.

## %For a scientist and mom, successful conservation takes a village

The shiny tiles of the Anchorage International Airport stretch before me as I navigate my cumbersome load to the nearest restroom. My two-and-a-half-year-old, whose potty training is the impetus for this trek, is happily chattering away on my back while I try to dodge fellow passengers. I’m 33 weeks pregnant and traveling with my toddler to study seabirds. More than once this morning I have asked myself, “What were you thinking?”

It’s mid-July and we’re traveling over 600 miles to the village of Savoonga on Sivuqaq/St. Lawrence Island in Alaska to set up seasonal auklet monitoring that will help us evaluate the health of the Bering Sea ecosystem. Balancing childcare and work, I’ve brought my toddler Toryn and “Snickerdoodle” whose occupation of my uterus comes with a lot of reminders to slow down. So, on this trip, I’ve brought extra help. Dr. Adrian Gall, a fellow mom scientist, is accompanying me from Fairbanks. She worked on Sivuqaq/St. Lawrence Island auklets for her master's research in the 2000s and also has a kid in tow: her 13-year-old son Gavin, whose previous visit to the island was while his mom was pregnant with him.

To be clear, I am not an epic mom-scientist doing it all. Most days I feel like I am failing at pretty much every important part of my life. Did I exercise my dog today? No. Could I have responded more productively to Toryn spitting in the house? Yes. When will I actually finish those revisions on the proposal that I wanted to complete three months ago? Who knows. The list goes on. It is very long.

In fact, to make anything happen in my life—work or otherwise—remotely resembling “epic” takes a lot of support, which got me thinking about how this small trip encapsulated the commitment, trust, relationships, and the sheer number of people that are required to make conservation happen. To do this trip totally on my own, pregnant, with a toddler in tow, would’ve been impossible and medically inadvisable. But with Adrian and our connections in Savoonga, the reality was that this trip was relatively easy. I love Savoonga, Adrian loves Savoonga, and she has deep ties with people there from her graduate school days. I know I am safe there. My toddler is safe. If something were to happen, we’d be looked after. This trip was only possible because of a community: a support network that includes a village, colleagues, co-workers, and family members, chipping in in large and small ways so that this weeklong visit to set up ecosystem monitoring in a rapidly changing part of our world could happen.

This is what conservation actually is: many people, from many different places, contributing at the level they can to get the job done. We’re meeting people where they are, accepting their values, making space for their priorities, and working together. Sometimes that means going to the beach with your kid and eating make-believe dishes comprised entirely of sand while one family has a bonfire nearby and another checks on their fish net. It is showing up, caring, and being there year after year. It is not glamorous, and certainly not epic. Maybe successful conservation is actually made up of a lot of small moments, some awkward, some uncomfortable, some funny, some challenging, and some worth treasuring. And, of course, there’s bound to be at least one trip to the bathroom along the way.

## %Glimpsing polar bears at the edge of the Arctic

Awe and excitement filled our Polar Rover the first day we ventured out on the partially frozen Hudson Bay. Just over a dozen of us had traveled to Churchill, Manitoba, on the southern edge of the Arctic to witness one of nature’s greatest spectacles: hundreds of wild polar bears congregating as they wait for the bay’s water to freeze before crossing to their winter hunting grounds.

Blanketed in snow and ice, this remote wilderness provides ideal habitat for the iconic bears. It’s also home to arctic foxes, arctic hares, willow ptarmigans, and snowy owls—to name more of the species we saw—that are equally adapted to life on the tundra. Some of these animals are so well camouflaged that only the sharpest eyes can spot them.

As we traveled through Churchill’s Wildlife Management Area, it wasn’t long before we encountered a pair of sparring male bears. The two put on a show, switching between playful wrestling and bursts of mock fighting on their hind legs. Other bears padded across the terrain, pausing occasionally to sniff the air or rub against piles of seaweed. Perhaps most captivating was the sight of a mother and her two cubs resting on a slope of fresh snow, embraced by the afternoon’s golden light.

Observing these mammals inspired us to reflect on the realities of a changing climate. Polar bears depend on sea ice to travel, hunt, rest, and mate. As the Arctic warms, the animals’ future is becoming increasingly uncertain. But for those of us privileged to see them up close, one thing is clear: We must advocate on behalf of all arctic species living on the front lines of climate change.

## %WHAT SEABIRDS CAN TELL US ABOUT OUR OCEANS

As seabirds go, auklets are truly a bellwether of the health of our northern oceans. These charmingly social and charismatic birds help us monitor entire ecosystems when we research their activity by counting them, collecting samples, and spending time near them. These important long-term studies help us identify climate and ocean trends and indicate how things are changing.

Since 2016, WWF biologist Alexis Will has been monitoring the auklet species that nest near Savoonga, Alaska, a small community on the island of Sivuqaq in the middle of the northern Bering Sea. While there are six total species of auklet, least and crested auklets make up the colony there, breeding in rock crevices along windswept cliffs bordering the ocean.

The colony consists of 17,814 least auklets and 128,208 crested auklets. That may seem like quite a crowd, but at their largest, colonies number between 1 million and 3 million when they breed. Their busy breeding months have them constantly flying and foraging in search of tasty copepods, other zooplankton, and krill. They lay a single egg and raise just one chick each summer.

“I love auklets because they are fierce, energetic, animated, social, and spunky,” Will said. “To me they are mysterious and hold the promise of revealing interesting things about the ocean.”

### %WHAT SEABIRDS CAN TELL US ABOUT OUR OCEANS: What auklets reveal about ocean health

The climate crisis is affecting auklets’ food source—the zooplankton community. To better understand what is available for the auklets to eat, Will and her team look at the sustenance they bring back to their chicks.

Adult auklets will offload (ahem, puke up) the food they are carrying in their gular pouch, a “throat” pouch accessible under their tongue, for their chicks. Then the researchers will use a tongue depressor to scrape the leftover regurgitation off the rocks. Generally, orange puke means lots of copepods and purple puke means mostly euphausiids, but samples are taken back to the lab where they are sorted and identified by a plankton expert.

The team also measures nutritional stress to understand how changes in diet, sea ice, or the increased presence of large predatory fish moving north from the southeastern Bering Sea affect auklets. Not a lot stresses out a breeding seabird. If they are in good enough condition to show up at the colony and make a breeding attempt, then the only stressor they face is food shortage, or some other nutrient limiting conditions such as prey that’s low in calorie content, difficult to reach or catch, or low in population. The avian stress hormone corticosterone can be measured in blood, feathers, and feces. The team collects blood and feather samples to track nutritional stress throughout the year. This measure complements the diet collection because it interprets what the prey composition means for the birds and how other ecological factors may be influencing their ability to obtain adequate food.

When combined with regional seabird monitoring data, other ecological data such as plankton and fish distributions, and physical data like sea ice extent, the monitoring data collected on Sivuqaq contribute to a broader understanding of how the northern Bering Sea ecosystem is responding to climate change. The data collected and observations by local community members are also compiled as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s ecosystem status report, delivered annually to the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council for use in their ecosystem-based management approach.

“The information provided by least auklets contributes to our understanding of the consequences of environmental change and supplies clues about how communities and ecosystem processes respond to physical forces,” Will said. “Continued warming of the magnitude seen in recent years could become a cause for concern for auklets and other planktivores in the Bering Sea if it alters prey availability in ways detrimental to their populations.”

### %WHAT SEABIRDS CAN TELL US ABOUT OUR OCEANS: Adapting to a more dynamic environment

For those living in or studying the Arctic, and those whose culture and well-being are inextricably linked to the health of the Arctic ecosystem, climate change has repercussions beyond impacts such as sea ice loss. Alaska Natives, who have survived assimilation and persecution by the US government, find that their culture and way of life are again under threat. Arctic peoples now must adapt quickly to change, shifting their hunting seasons and techniques and working with researchers to understand how the climate crisis is affecting wildlife populations so that they can continue to live with marine life in a sustainable way. The pace of change is unprecedented and requires that we all adapt our understanding and expectations of what these ecosystems will look like in the future. It is unrealistic—and potentially very harmful to everyone’s mental health—to hold onto the vision of what the Arctic once was. Instead, we will have to learn to appreciate what the Arctic is becoming, and work together to ensure that there are still places left for the species that require sea ice to flourish.

Auklets are perhaps the best example of how resilient Arctic ecosystems may be. Their distribution in the Bering Sea has likely changed in response to long-term changes in climate, expanding and contracting as glaciers advanced and melted, and capitalizing on emerging productivity hotspots, even in the last 50 years. As the northern Bering Sea changes, and the ecosystem restructures, auklets can help us understand how interactions between species are changing, and whether the number of species it can support changes. Auklets may be messengers of distress when their colonies empty out and their chicks starve, but they are also a reminder that not all is lost, and that it is possible to have a successful breeding season after a series of failed ones; it is still possible for us to curb the worst impacts of a warming planet.
