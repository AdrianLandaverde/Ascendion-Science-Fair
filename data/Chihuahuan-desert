# %CHIHUAHUAN DESERT

The Chihuahuan is the largest desert in North America-stretching all the way from the southwestern United States deep into the Central Mexican Highlands. WWF's conservation efforts focus on the Big Bend region of the northern Chihuahuan Desert, which includes important parts of the Rio Grande/Bravo watershed in the U.S. and Mexico.  Because of the region's high altitude (3,000 to 5,000 feet) winters and nights are cool while summer days can reach temperatures over 100 degrees. Very little rain falls in the area, but underground springs, small streams and the Rio Grande River provide precious water.

The magnificent landscape is threatened by an ever-increasing human population, water misuse and mismanagement, overgrazing by cattle and goats, and a lack of knowledge regarding the desert's ecological importance. For more than 15 years, WWF and its bi-national partners have been working in the northern Chihuahuan Desert to protect and bring back freshwater and grassland ecosystems for the benefit of wildlife and people.

CONTINENT: North America
SPECIES: Prairie dog, Kit fox, Mule deer, Pronghorn, Blacktailed jackrabbits

## %SPECIES

The desert is home to more than 130 species of mammals, such as the Mule deer and pronghorn. The kit fox roams the vast grasslands of the northern desert. The Chihuahuan Desert boasts 3,000 plant species, including more than 500 of the world's 1,500 species of cactus. The desert also harbors North America's largest prairie dog colony as well as nesting sites and migratory habitats for more than 500 bird species. More than 110 native freshwater fish species ply its rivers. In the desert scrub, roadrunners scurry after earless lizards while golden eagles search among the agave and creosote for blacktailed jackrabbits.

The Rio Grande-Rio Bravo mainstem and Rio Conchos contain important large river habitats in an otherwise dry region. Large scale ecological phenomena such as bird migrations also follow these watercourses. The aquatic fauna has evolved to live under highly variable cycles of flooding and drought both within and across years.

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

The Chihuahuan Desert, long a corridor for trade between Mexico City and Santa Fe, New Mexico, is now home to five million people. The Rio Grande basin covers 172,000 square miles, crossing three U.S. states, more than a dozen Native American nations and five Mexican states. The region is home to some of the poorest and fastest growing jurisdictions in both countries. The North American Free Trade Agreement is fueling economic and population booms on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. A border town just across the Rio Grande River from El Paso, Juarez, or Ciudad Juarez, is the largest metropolitan area in the Chihuahuan Desert region. Other large towns in this region are Chihuahua and Torreón in Mexico and Albuquerque, Las Cruces, and Roswell in the U.S. A prominent native group in this area of northwestern Mexico is the Rarámuri, or Tarahumara. They live in highlands of the Sierra Madre Occidental (often called the Sierra Tarahumara).

## %THREATS

This magnificent desert landscape is threatened by population growth, poor water management, agricultural expansion, invasive species, illegal wildlife trade, and a lack of understanding about the desert's ecological importance. The region's watersheds are suffering from overuse, construction of dams, groundwater extraction, pollution, and the drying impacts of climate change.

The main threats are:

- WATER SCARCITY
- CONVERSION OF LAND

### %THREATS: WATER SCARCITY

Population pressure in the Big Bend region is the most prominent threat to the northern Chihuahuan Desert. The Rio Grande-Rio Bravo river system is the primary source of water for 5.5 million people on the border, and the river's waters are already 150% over-allocated, mostly for the agriculture sector. Groundwater is faring no better; 43 of the desert's aquifers are overexploited. Water is particularly important in the Chihuahuan Desert, where the region's poor are largely dependent on the desert's natural resources for their livelihoods.

### %THREATS: CONVERSION OF LAND

Overgrazing by cattle, sheep, and goats decimate native grasses, increase the number of shrubs, and promote desertification. Unsustainable harvesting and illegal poaching present serious threats to the region's biodiversity, which includes rare plants and reptiles. Extraction of copper, gypsum, salt, lime and sand have degraded the region.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: PROMOTING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN BIG BEND

WWF collaborates on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border to implement an integrated conservation management plan in the Big Bend region of Texas and northern Mexico.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: UPLAND RESTORATION

As part of its upland restoration program, WWF works with the Tarahumara people on a range of projects that bridge natural resource conservation and socioeconomic considerations. This includes reducing soil erosion and enhancing water availability, installing low-tech water treatment facilities, and replanting vegetation uplands. WWF is helping to change the legal framework in Mexico to minimize environmental impacts of water concessions and create a system of economic incentives for sustainable management of grasslands.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: RESTORING FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS

WWF engages communities and works with a diverse group of agencies, institutions, and organizations in both the U.S. and Mexico to restore the health of the Rio Grande-Rio Bravo river system and its tributaries. This requires creating an integrated river basin management framework. Along the Big Bend reach of the Rio Grande, WWF and its bi-national partners are conducting a variety of scientific investigations to better understand changes in the river and its current condition.

## %Climate-smart conservation along the Rio Grande

The Rio Grande-Rio Bravo is the lifeblood of the water scarce Chihuahuan desert region. The river and its tributaries serve as the primary source of water for some 6 million people, and provide food and shelter to a number of plant and animal species. But, climate change, coupled with rising populations and diversifying demands, threatens the river’s future and the future of those who rely on it. To increase the resiliency of the river and all who depend on it, WWF and local partners are restoring crucial ecosystems. This includes transforming bare riparian areas, which were cleared decades ago for mining and construction activities, into thriving habitats full of local vegetation.

After carefully studying the watershed, WWF meets with managers at the O2 Ranch, which includes critical riparian areas for Terlingua Creek, a tributary of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo. The ranchers are intimately familiar with how rainwater flows over the 272,000 acres of O2, and their expertise helps identify the exact location of planting and the planting design. The ranchers also understand that improving this area will increase water retention and improve soil health, which benefits their business.

Coyote willow and cottonwood branches are harvested from several sites upstream in Terlingua Creek, as well as along the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo as it flows through Big Bend National Park. The harvested branches are soaked in pools for a week prior to planting to increase the likelihood of survival after planting.

Using track hoe and motorized auger, the team digs holes for the willow poles.

The revegetation covers 3 hectares in an area that is critical for Terlingua Creek. Improved vegetation will increase the amount of water that reaches the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo downstream, absorb excess water from extreme rainfall or floods, and reduce the amount of soil and sediment that flows into the river system, clogging its channels.

After planting, the poles are carefully surveyed to determine their survival rate and whether additional plantings will be needed.

In addition to building resiliency against climate change, as the vegetation grows in this riparian area, it provides new, native habitats for wildlife, including birds and monarch butterflies.

## %US Climate Assessment: An Urgent Call to Tackle Climate Change

Extreme weather events, melting glaciers and rising sea levels—all with links to climate change—are impacting the United States and the world, according to a new report by a group of leading US scientists and released by the White House on May 6, 2014.

The National Climate Assessment provides a detailed look at the far-reaching effects of climate change on our nation’s communities and natural resources, including changes to oceans, water resources, energy supply, agriculture, forestry, and ecosystems.

“This report reads like it was ripped from today’s headlines,” said WWF Vice President for Climate Change Lou Leonard. “It paints the clearest picture yet that extreme weather and climate disruption are already here and, simply put, it’s not pretty.”

Some extreme weather events linked to climate change, such as prolonged periods of heat, heavy downpours, and floods and droughts, are growing in frequency and/or intensity, according to the report. Warming is also “causing sea level to rise and glaciers and Arctic sea ice to melt, and oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb carbon dioxide,” the report says.

“While climate impacts are significant, the good news here is that we can avoid the dangerous future predicted this report if we start today using this information to prepare our cities for these risks and changing the way our nation uses and chooses energy,” said Leonard. “That’s beginning to happen. Americans are embracing renewable energy technologies like rooftop solar panels. And the federal government’s work to set new standards for old, dirty power plants is also playing a large role in moving our nation toward a renewable energy future and reducing the emissions that drive climate change.”

In addition to nationwide findings, the report provides insight into specific parts of the country, including places where WWF works to conserve wildlife such as the Artic, Northern Great Plains and desert Southwest.

In the Arctic, the report finds that Alaska has already warmed twice as fast as the rest of the nation. As a result, Arctic summer sea ice is receding faster than previously projected and is expected to virtually disappear before mid-century. This threatens the long-term health of walrus and polar bear populations that rely on it for survival. It’s also opening new areas to development, creating a new set of threats to this incredibly diverse and important ecosystem.

In its section on the Great Plains, the report looks at recent increases in winter and spring precipitation in the Northern Great Plains and its impact on agriculture and soils. It also examines how the length of the growing season is changing, possibly allowing a second annual crop in some places and some years.

And in the arid Southwest, where WWF works to restore and improve the Rio Grande, the report points out how climate change is affecting water resources, ecosystems, energy supply and agricultural production. Among its findings, the assessment points out that snowpack and streamflow amounts are projected to decline in parts of the Southwest, decreasing surface water supply reliability for cities, agriculture, and ecosystems.

The findings outlined in this report are another reminder of why WWF is working to engage millions of American about the need to transition our nation to a renewable energy future. Preparing local communities and reducing our emissions that drive climate change is critical to providing future generations a healthy planet.
