# %THE GALÁPAGOS

Six hundred miles off the coast of Ecuador lie the volcanic islands of the Galápagos, famous for a wealth of unique plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. The Galápagos Islands were the source of Darwin’s theory of evolution and remain a priceless living laboratory for scientists today.

Illegal fishing, non-native species and the demands of more than 160,000 tourists each year threaten this irreplaceable ecosystem and the people who depend on it for their food and livelihoods. WWF spearheaded conservation efforts in the Galápagos, including funding the construction of the Charles Darwin Research Station. For more than 50 years we have played an integral role in protecting nature in the Galápagos and with our partners we continue our ambitious conservation work which is critical to every human, plant and animal on the islands.

In 1998, the Ecuadorian government enacted the Galápagos Special Law, a legal framework to protect the Galápagos, and created the Galápagos Marine Reserve. WWF supported its establishment and continues to be involved in the management process that helps the reserve succeed.

CONTINENT: South America
SPECIES: Sea lion, Galapagos penguin, Giant tortoise, Great white shark, Leatherback turtle, Sei whale

## %SPECIES

The sheer number and variety of wildlife both on land and in the water of the Galápagos is quite remarkable. Because of the islands’ isolation and remoteness, many of these species are found only in the Galápagos and have not changed much since prehistoric times. The Galápagos’ famous marine iguanas, albatross and giant tortoises continue to amaze scientists and delight tourists. Many unique species occur in great concentrations. For example, marine iguanas bask on the beaches by the hundreds, and on certain islands hundreds of birds may be seen at one time.

The main species are: 
- Sea Turtle
- Leatherback Turtle
- Sei Whale
- Green Turtle
- Whale
- Marine Iguana
- Giant Tortoise
- Galápagos Penguin
- Sea Lions
- Great White Shark
- Tuna
- Albacore Tuna
- Bigeye Tuna
- Skipjack Tuna
- Shark

## %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES

The islands were discovered in 1535, but were vacant of humans until the 1800s due to their inhospitable terrain. In the 1920s, European and North American settlers began to arrive, as well as Ecuadorians who came to fish and farm. Beginning in the 1960s, tourism and new fisheries brought more settlers. Along with these new economic activities, more and more people migrated to the islands. The Galápagos’ population has increased from roughly 3,000 in the 1960s to about 30,000 in 2012. Four of the islands are inhabited, with most people living on Santa Cruz and San Cristóbal. The nature of the Galápagos provides livelihoods based on tourism, fisheries, and commerce.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: HELPING ARTISANAL FISHERMEN

The intense competition to catch lobster in the Galápagos drives fishermen to pour their money into new vessels and gear. It also leads them to work under risky and dangerous conditions as they dive deeper for longer amounts of time in order to maintain or increase their catch rates. As a result, the number of fishermen with decompression sickness has alarmingly increased over the last decade. WWF tries to relieve this dangerous competition among fishermen (also allowing lobster stocks to recover) and increase incomes by promoting the commercialization of live lobster instead of tails—worth twice as much on the market.

### %PEOPLE & COMMUNITIES: CONSERVATION TRAINING

Since 2007, WWF has been awarding scholarships to outstanding Galápagos students to pursue training in environmental management, tourism and business administration. Training the next generation of conservation leaders is important for the long-term conservation of the Galápagos Islands. This scholarship project builds upon other WWF education-centered activities that improve the educational system in the Galápagos.

## %THREATS

The main threats are:

- ILLEGAL AND OVERFISHING
- UNSUSTAINABLE TOURISM
- POLLUTION

### %THREATS: ILLEGAL AND OVERFISHING

The Galápagos Marine Reserve is one of the largest marine protected areas in the world, which makes monitoring and patrolling expensive and challenging. Its rich diversity of marine life also makes it attractive to illegal fishing interests. Overfishing and illegal industrial fishing are serious threats to the islands’ delicate marine ecosystem. They deplete commercial fish, destroy marine environments, and harm local communities whose livelihoods and health depend on fish. Almost all of the Galápagos’ commercially important coastal species are being overfished. WWF addresses the root causes by supporting the Galápagos National Park to improve the control and surveillance system of the Galápagos Marine Reserve. We also promote an artisanal fishing culture that embraces sustainable fishing practices and maximizes catch while minimizing environmental impacts.

### %THREATS: UNSUSTAINABLE TOURISM

Worldwide fame has turned the Galápagos Islands into one of the most popular tourist destinations. Increased visitors as well as rapid human development bring higher demand for imported goods and fossil fuels, introduction of invasive species, and more demand for qualified labor (which comes primarily from mainland Ecuador), migration, and infrastructure needs. Increasing human pressure on the fragile archipelago becomes a potential threat to conservation and local sustainable development.

### %THREATS: POLLUTION

Increased generation of waste and improper waste management continue to threaten the land and waters of the Galápagos. These threats relate directly to a large number of inhabitants and tourists and to new consumption patterns and lifestyles. Litter and poorly managed waste easily becomes marine debris which affects the fragile marine ecosystem and even the coasts of uninhabited islands. An unknown number of animals are killed every year when they become entangled in pieces of string or plastic bags, or consume floating trash.

## %WHAT WWF IS DOING

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: INNOVATIVE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

WWF works with the lobster fishing communities in the Galápagos Islands to embrace sustainable practices and to promote a new fishing rights-based approach. This would encourage fishermen to catch quality products rather than large volumes and eliminate the intense competition, overfishing and dangerous conditions that happen as a result. We also promote a transition to live lobster rather than tails and pilot live lobster tanks to supply local restaurants. This switch would increase lobsters’ market value and income for fishermen.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: IMPROVED MONITORING OF THE GALÁPAGOS MARINE RESERVE

In the past, the Galápagos National Park struggled to enforce the law that protects the reserve from harmful fishing activity. Park managers were faced with high operating costs and inadequate resources to patrol the large marine reserve. WWF, together with key partners, has helped create more efficient ways to monitor vessels in the marine reserve, using the latest technology such as satellite, radio and radars. Such systems have been very effective at detecting illegal fishing activities and minimizing the risk of vessel accidents, which could lead to oil spills. We also support training of park wardens on these technologies to better equip them to handle such threats against the Reserve’s natural resources.

### %WHAT WWF IS DOING: IMPLEMENTING ECOTOURISM

WWF wants to ensure that tourism in Galápagos becomes a tool for conservation and sustainable development. We help the Galápagos to design and implement a new ecotourism-based model to both support conservation and improve people’s livelihoods through collaboration with partners, governments and communities. WWF was a key player during a three-year process to develop the model, which includes improving local governance, designing new ecotourism activities, promoting an ecotourism-oriented culture and monitoring the impact of the tourism sector. We are also working on reducing the ecological footprint caused by the industry and visitors.

## %How WWF protects sea turtle species across the Pacific

Across the vast Pacific Ocean, sea turtles travel huge distances to find food, shelter, and suitable nesting beaches. To help protect these endangered sea turtles—and all that depends on their support—WWF works with people in Indonesia, Ecuador, and Fiji. 

Take a look at what WWF is doing to help: 

- Leatherback Turtle | Indonesia
- Green Turtle | Indonesia, Ecuador
- Hawksbill Turtle | Fiji

### %How WWF protects sea turtle species across the Pacific: Leatherback Turtle | Indonesia

Leatherback sea turtles migrate between the west coast of the US and Indonesia in search of food and nesting beaches. However, over the last 30 to 50 years, high levels of egg poaching and hunting of adult turtles beyond customary levels across Indonesia's Kei and Buru islands had a dramatic impact; 75% of eggs were being harvested annually and the greater population declined by 78%. To address this, WWF works with local Indonesian communities on a monitoring program to discourage egg harvesting and turtle capture and on education programs through local church and youth group leaders to spread information about the need to protect turtles and their ecosystems. As a result, egg poaching has fallen to less than 1% and the direct take of adults has declined by 84% since 2017.

### %How WWF protects sea turtle species across the Pacific: Green Turtle | Indonesia, Ecuador

Accidental capture by fishing net is a major problem for green sea turtles, which can't see nets floating in the water and can quickly become entangled. WWF and partners are tackling green sea turtle entanglement by adding lights to gillnets. Trials of net illumination in Kalimantan, Indonesia, led to a 70% decrease in sea turtle capture! Now, WWF is looking to replace AA battery-powered lights with solar-powered lights and continue trials in Ecuador to save green sea turtles across the Pacific.

### %How WWF protects sea turtle species across the Pacific: Hawksbill Turtle | Fiji

Seventy-five percent of Fijians live along the coast, and marine wildlife, including critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles, are closely tied to Fijian culture and traditions and vital to the health of Fiji's Great Sea Reef. In Fiji, WWF is working to protect these turtles through two methods: sponsoring a network of community monitors, or daunivonu, to raise awareness and protect nests and turtles from capture; and educating all 600 fishers working in the tuna industry to reduce the accidental capture of hawksbill turtles.

## %How community and Indigenous efforts contribute to protecting our oceans

Our ocean’s spectacular wildlife and plant life are at risk as biodiversity around the world teeters on the brink of irreversible loss. But the world is coming together to take action. To reverse nature loss, the Convention on Biological Diversity, a United Nations treaty focused on ecosystems, species, and genetic resources, has adopted an agreement to protect 30% of land, freshwater, and oceans by 2030—an effort commonly known as “30x30.” 

Clearly, change is needed to protect our ocean’s incredible wildlife, but we also need to ensure that such protection doesn’t cut off access to the ocean’s many varied resources for the hundreds of millions of people who depend on them.

While marine protected areas are the most well-known pathway to protect marine life and can incorporate community resource needs, there are other solutions that can also support both people and nature living along coasts. Those involved in ocean conservation are increasingly turning toward one such solution known as ‘other effective conservation measures’ (OECMs) to work alongside marine protected areas as complementary pathways that protect our ocean ecosystems. OECMs are geographic sites that are not within a protected area, that deliver long-term biodiversity conservation under equitable governance and management. They embrace the power and importance of local community involvement in protecting ocean ecosystems and recognize that many people already integrate conservation actions into their lives through religious or traditional preservation. With the community’s consent, governments can formally recognize these actions as OECMs, which could not only give legal recognition of Indigenous and community rights to the area but also count towards global biodiversity conservation targets such as 30x30.

WWF is working with coastal communities in Chile, Ecuador, and many other countries to encourage governments to formally recognize this community-led work, legitimize community and Indigenous actions, and support the protection of our ocean wildlife.

### %How community and Indigenous efforts contribute to protecting our oceans: Chile

On the Pacific coast of Northern Patagonia, about 24.85 miles from Chile’s Chiloé archipelago, lies a 50,000-acre island known as Guafo. Its position in the Gulf of Corcovado makes the island a critical habitat for migratory whales, dolphins, sea lions, sea birds, and other marine life—and a site of cultural and spiritual significance to the Indigenous Mapuche Hillichue communities of southern Chiloé.

The cultural and natural importance of Guafo has motivated a group of 11 Indigenous communities of Chiloé to promote the initiative "Wuafo Wapi, ancestral territory for conservation." Wuafo Wapi seeks the declaration of a Coastal Marine Area of Original Peoples (ECMPO) in Guafo, the establishment of which would block any development that could be detrimental to the cultural, ecological, and ecosystem characteristics in the designated area. The proposal was officially presented to the National Corporation for Indigenous Development with the technical support of WWF Chile and approved by Chile’s Undersecretary of Fisheries and Aquaculture. WWF is currently exploring how the OECM mechanism can bring a more inclusive and Indigenous-led approach to marine coastal conservation for the communities of Chiloé.

### %How community and Indigenous efforts contribute to protecting our oceans: Ecuador

Ecuador has rich and plentiful marine life which is, in part, thanks to the mangroves that line 61% of the country’s coastline. The coastal trees lock down sediment under their tangled roots, preventing it from smothering corals—home to important fishing grounds and a hotspot for biodiversity. The roots also provide shelter for shellfish as well as young juvenile fish, giving them a safe space to live until they grow large enough to venture out into open water and join the larger food web that supports a $5.5 billion industry in fish exports alone. These magnificent trees also store carbon, making them hugely important in curbing global warming, and protecting coastlines from storms. 

Despite these benefits, Ecuador’s mangroves are threatened by clear-cutting for illegal and unsustainable shrimp farming. To protect the largest stretch of mangrove forest while also allowing sustainable resource use, the government has conceded mangrove land rights to communities in the Gulf of Guayaquil so that they have the legal protection to continue traditional and sustainable harvest of mangrove crabs while also helping to report any clear-cutting to law enforcement. This mangrove concessions concept has the potential to be categorized as an OECM in the future and attain formal recognition by the government as Ecuador calculates its contributions to 30x30. The benefits of the program can be two-fold: protecting the mangrove ecosystems and directly benefiting people. However, more work is still needed to protect crabbing communities as interactions with pirates or shrimp farmers can become deadly.

## %Eliminating fisheries crime calls for innovative partnerships. WWF just helped launch one.

Just mention the name “Galapagos Islands” and, even though 99% of the world has never visited, there is a shared understanding of what the place represents. It’s an environment unlike any other.

The Galapagos Islands, and the protected marine national park that surrounds the archipelago, provide cultural value, health, and economic security for all of Ecuador. But this ocean region is under increasing pressure from climate change, a race to capture resources, and competing economic agendas.

“Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is the main problem that the fishery faces in Ecuador,” said Tarsicio Granizo, country director for WWF-Ecuador. Additionally, the presence of international fishing fleets in and around Ecuador are putting biodiversity at risk.

Working at the intersection of maritime security and fisheries management is increasingly important for conservation. Unsustainable fishing and illegal fishing perpetuate each other: as fish stocks decline, fishing vessels are more likely to use illegal methods while illegal fishing accelerates declines in fish stocks. The incredible biodiversity found in the waters around Ecuador makes it a high priority for WWF.

To protect this critical environment, WWF and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s Global Maritime Crime Program have launched a new partnership to advance innovative knowledge-sharing. The goals are to leverage fisheries science and targeted sector information to enable more capacity to counteract illegal fishing activities and to demonstrate how the conservation and maritime security communities can build on each other's core competencies for greater impact.

“Information is power and having access to the best available information can make a world of difference for our oceans and the communities that live alongside them,” said Johan Bergenas, WWF’s senior vice president for Oceans. “We want to get the best fisheries science and the best information on seafood supply chains in the hands of the people who are training enforcement agencies.”

The government of Ecuador and the Galapagos National Park have in place state-of-the-art technology for maritime domain awareness which provide information about ocean security, safety, the economy, and the environment. Consequently, Ecuador provides an opportunity to learn quickly how innovative partnerships and information sharing can further marine conservation efforts.

### %Eliminating fisheries crime calls for innovative partnerships. WWF just helped launch one: Solutions need a foundation of good information

In many places, monitoring and control information exists to combat crimes at sea, but the scale of the problems has swamped the scale of existing solutions. Building new partnerships to reach more people with critical information is one way to improve the trajectory of oceans solutions.

Without knowledge generation, applied science, and monitoring programs that generate new analysis, it is impossible to sustainably manage fishery resources and conserve marine biodiversity species of high interest. As the old saying goes, "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it."

“The UNODC-WWF partnership is essential in ensuring an informed law enforcement response to crimes in the fisheries sector, where innovative information sharing is combined with the use of technology as part of a maritime domain awareness approach,” said Siri Bjune, head of the UNODC Global Maritime Crime Program.

Added Pablo Guerrero, WWF-Ecuador's director of seascape conservation, “The idea is to generate a model that we can replicate in other countries and a model that can be scalable, that can be increased, at the sub-regional or regional level, because the crimes that take place in the marine landscape are crimes that transcend borders.”

### %Eliminating fisheries crime calls for innovative partnerships. WWF just helped launch one: Eliminating fisheries conflict has climate change implications, too

As declines in fisheries contribute to escalating geopolitical tension and conflict on the ocean, successful ocean conservation must include natural resource conflict resolution, and peacebuilding, as well as law enforcement capacity building.

Climate change makes this work even more critical. An analysis published by UNODC and WWF makes the link between crimes against the environment and the climate and biodiversity crises. The paper notes that in order to “support nature’s ability to mitigate climate change, it is critical to scale up initiatives to combat environmental crime and integrate the justice system’s response to these crimes into biodiversity, climate, and circular economy agendas.”

## %Life among the mangroves

Straddling the land and the sea with a tangle of arching roots, mangrove trees guard coastlines all over the world. Mangroves recycle pollutants, maintain water quality, and provide habitat and a secure source of food for wildlife and people. They also play a vital role in climate health. The trees can store carbon for hundreds—sometimes even thousands—of years, making mangrove forests among the most carbon-rich habitats on Earth. Mangrove forests cover roughly between 33 million and 49 million acres of the globe and are one of the most complex and productive ecosystems on the planet.

Among the tangled root systems, reaching branches, and fluttering leaves of mangrove forests, you can find a colorful variety of wildlife who call these trees home. Their leaves are the basis of an incredibly productive food web, beginning with providing nutrients for algae and invertebrates, which in turn feeds many other organisms. The reach of the benefits that mangroves provide goes much beyond forest boundaries. The role of mangroves in ecosystem function serves to protect wildlife from all around the world.

Meet the wildlife that live among mangroves:

- Proboscis monkey
- Mangrove tree crab
- Dugong
- Mangrove finch
- Key deer
- Continental tiger

### %Life among the mangroves: Proboscis monkey

Easily recognized by its bulbous and elongated nose, the endangered proboscis monkey is found in the mangrove swamps of Borneo and Indonesia. Protected by the thick tree canopy from predators like the estuarine crocodile and clouded leopard, these monkeys elect to rest and sleep among the trees. It is typical for proboscis monkeys to feed on the mangroves. They have an appetite for young leaves or shoots, flowers, and young fruits found in the trees. In fact, proboscis monkeys have special bacteria in their stomachs that help to digest mangrove leaves, enabling the digestion of cellulose, a fiber found in plants, and ridding the leaves of any potential toxins. Unfortunately, mangrove deforestation threatens the monkey’s habitat, food source, and, subsequently, population numbers.

### %Life among the mangroves: Mangrove tree crab

Mangrove tree crabs live along the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to the southern coast of Brazil. These small crustaceans rely on mangroves for both habitat and food. During high tide, you can find the crabs scurrying up mangrove tree branches as they seek refuge from the impending waters. As the tide recedes, the crabs prefer to shuffle along the base of the mangrove swamps, scavenging in tree roots for food, including parts of the trees themselves. Red mangrove leaves make up an estimated 84% of an adult mangrove tree crab’s diet. These crabs serve as a link between the primary production of mangroves and the detrital, or decomposer-based, food web. This contributes to the overall ecosystem health of the mangrove forests in which they reside.

### %Life among the mangroves: Dugong

Swimming in the seas that reach East Africa’s mangrove swamps can be found the dugong, a vulnerable marine mammal that is often mistaken for its cousin, the manatee, due to its gray appearance and oblong body. The relationship among mangroves, dugongs, and the seagrasses they feed on supports the survival of all three. Mangroves serve as buffers to storm surges for coastal communities, and this power is amplified with the assistance of seagrasses. Seagrasses stabilize sediment to reduce the impact of the sea’s current and surges to protect mangrove trees. In return, mangroves filter out this sediment and excess nutrients that would otherwise damage the seagrasses, enhancing the productivity and resilience of seagrasses for dugongs to feed on. Dugongs are considered an indicator species for their habitat, meaning that when dugongs are sighted in our seas, healthy seagrasses can be found beneath the water’s surface.

### %Life among the mangroves: Mangrove finch

The rarest bird in the Galápagos, the mangrove finch, can only be found fluttering among the branches of the mangrove forests on the western islands of the Galápagos. These iconic Darwin finches are small, typically only about 14 centimeters long, boasting olive-toned brown plumage and delicate beaks. Mangrove finches use these beaks to carefully lift mangrove tree bark and rummage through fallen piles of leaves to search for insects. They rely on mangrove forests to sustain their eating habits. With only around 100 individuals remaining, this species is in critical danger of extinction. In fact, mangrove finches are one of the most range-restricted birds in the world. Previously claiming habitat on two Galapagos Islands, Fernandina and Isabela, the mangrove finch can now only be found on the northwest coast of Isabela. The pristine mangrove forests of Isabela are necessary for the highly specific habitat requirements of the mangrove finch, making this specific patch of mangrove forest vital to the survival of this critically endangered species.

### %Life among the mangroves: Key deer

The Florida Keys are known for their idyllic beaches, and this strip of islands also features more than 1,800 miles of coastline dotted with mangroves. Here, one can find the key deer, an endangered deer species of only about 700 to 800 individuals left. Threatened by habitat loss due to rapid development, automobile collisions, disease, and the alteration of its habitat by a changing climate, key deer seek refuge in the mangrove forests of the Florida Keys. Faced with a depleting population and shrinking habitat area, mangrove conservation is a hot topic in the state as key deer populations shrink along with their habitat. Much like many other species whose habitat lies among the mangroves, conservation of mangroves and of key deer are ultimately intertwined.

### %Life among the mangroves: Continental tiger

Some Continental tigers prowl amid the entangled tree roots of mangrove forests. They rely on the foliage to stay hidden and stalk their prey. One of the most unique habitats for these iconic big cats is the Sundarbans mangrove forest, shared by India and Bangladesh. This UNESCO Heritage Site is the only forest where tigers live along a marine coast. The Sundarbans not only protect the tigers who live inside them but the communities outside. These magnificent trees protected coastal communities in Bangladesh and India from storm surges. Tigers are predators by nature and lie at the top of the food chain in the wild. Because of this, they play a profound role in ecosystem function overall, including that of the Sundarbans mangroves. Maintaining tigers thus means maintaining tiger habitats, which has great implications for the protection of humans and other wildlife in the area.

## %Expansion of protected areas signals progress for protection of Galápagos Islands

THE GALÁPAGOS ISLANDS :: ECUADOR

From rugged marine iguanas sunbathing on basalt shorelines to tortoises plodding across grassy plains, the Galápagos Islands boast unparalleled biodiversity. Earlier this year, the Ecuadorian government again confirmed its commitment to protecting this rich ecosystem by creating the Hermandad Marine Reserve—expanding the established protected area by nearly a third and bringing the total area of protected waters around the islands to nearly 77,000 square miles.

“The creation of the Hermandad Marine is fantastic news for Ecuadorians and for the world,” says Pablo Guerrero, marine conservation director for WWF-Ecuador. “These enchanted islands continue their journey as a living laboratory and take a great step toward achieving the common goal of protecting 30% of our planet’s oceans by 2030.”

Now the Ecuadorian government has called on WWF-Ecuador and other organizations to craft a long-term plan to guide the management of the new reserve. “This requires the active participation of all related sectors, including fisheries,” says Guerrero. “Adequate planning and zoning of the new area will guarantee inclusive conservation, tourism development, and economic benefits for everybody.”

## %Get a dose of nature without leaving home

Earlier this year, I was anxiously awaiting my first big trip to Africa—a safari to South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. But then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. I had to cancel my trip and, like everyone else, stay home. I was disappointed, of course, but I understood the importance of protecting myself and others. Then, as weeks turned into months, my longing for adventure grew. For me, travel provides pleasure and inspires learning, reminding me how connected we are to each other and to places.

To offer an escape to other homebound travelers and nature lovers like me, WWF teamed up with travel partner Natural Habitat Adventures to create Daily Dose of Nature, a series of webinars and films featuring people who have dedicated their lives to exploration, conservation, and helping local communities. In this series, the company’s intrepid expedition leaders and WWF’s mission-focused scientists and experts share stories about nature and exploration to lift our spirits during these challenging times—and to remind us of the importance of connecting with nature, with others, and with ourselves.

These virtual adventures have taken thousands of travelers and WWF supporters around the globe. We went to Alaska with WWF’s Arctic species expert Elisabeth Kruger to learn about the ecology of the Bering Strait. We learned about the history of conservation in the Amazonian rain forest from Amy Smith, deputy director of forests. Lauren Spurrier, WWF vice president of ocean conservation, guided us through the rich waters surrounding the Galápagos. We joined Clay Bolt, communications officer for WWF’s Northern Great Plains program, as he unpacked the plight of the rusty patched bumblebee.

And in a way, I even made it to Africa. Richard de Gouveia, a Natural Habitat Adventures expedition leader, guided me through Africa’s elephant landscapes and described how elephants’ low rumbles can travel through the ground for up to 10 miles—undetectable to the human ear. As I sit here, I feel my floor rumble. It could just be my kids playing in the next room, but it reminds me that though this webinar can’t replace an authentic experience, it does make me more excited to travel in the future.
